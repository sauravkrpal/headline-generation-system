# Headline Generation System

## Project Overview

The **Headline Generation System** is a machine learning-based solution that generates contextually relevant, catchy, and engaging headlines for news articles. This system aims to automate the headline generation process for publishers, bloggers, and media houses, ensuring fast and high-quality headline creation at scale.

By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model extracts meaningful features from news articles and predicts headlines using a machine learning model.

## Key Features

- **Contextual Headline Generation**: The system generates relevant headlines based on the content of the article.
- **Scalability**: Capable of processing large volumes of articles daily without compromising on quality.
- **Customizable**: Can be adapted for various domains such as sports, politics, entertainment, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is assessed using BLEU and ROUGE-L metrics to ensure high-quality results.
