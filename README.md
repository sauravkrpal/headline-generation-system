# Headline Generation System

## Project Overview

The **Headline Generation System** is a machine learning-based solution that generates contextually relevant, catchy, and engaging headlines for news articles. This system aims to automate the headline generation process for publishers, bloggers, and media houses, ensuring fast and high-quality headline creation at scale.

By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model extracts meaningful features from news articles and predicts headlines using a machine learning model.

## Key Features

- **Contextual Headline Generation**: The system generates relevant headlines based on the content of the article.
- **Scalability**: Capable of processing large volumes of articles daily without compromising on quality.
- **Customizable**: Can be adapted for various domains such as sports, politics, entertainment, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is assessed using BLEU and ROUGE-L metrics to ensure high-quality results.

### 3. **Data**

Explain the datasets used in the project, their formats, and how they are structured.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Data

The project uses the following datasets:

- **`LABELLED_TRAIN.csv`**: A CSV file containing labeled training data. It has two columns: 
  - `News Article`: The body of the news article.
  - `Caption`: The corresponding headline for the article.
```
## Installation

This section provides the steps to install the required dependencies and set up the project environment.
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/headline-generation-system.git
cd headline-generation-system


- **`LABELLED_DEV.csv`**: A CSV file used for validation purposes, containing similar columns to the training data. The `Caption` column serves as the ground truth for evaluating the model's performance.

- **`UNLABELLED_TEST.csv`**: A CSV file containing news articles without corresponding headlines. This dataset is used for generating predictions using the trained model.
```
## Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can use requirements.txt for this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Prepare the Data
Ensure you have the following data files in the data/ folder:

LABELLED_TRAIN.csv: Labeled training data
LABELLED_DEV.csv: Labeled validation data
UNLABELLED_TEST.csv: Unlabeled test data for making predictions


### 5. **Training the Model**

This section explains how to train the model using the provided training script.

**Example:**


## Training the Model

To train the headline generation model, run the following command:
```
python src/train_model.py
```
### 6. **Generating Predictions**

Explain how to use the trained model to generate predictions on new data (i.e., the test data).

**Example:**


Once the model is trained, you can generate predictions for the test data:

```b
python src/generate_predictions.py

```

### 7. **Evaluating the Model**

Provide instructions on how to evaluate the model using BLEU and ROUGE-L scores.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model's performance, use the following command:

python src/evaluate.py
```

### 8. **License**

Mention the license type for your project and give users permission to use, modify, and distribute your code.

**Example:**

```markdown``
## 9. Train the Model

You can train the model using the following script:
```markdown
python src/train_model.py
```
### 9. Generate Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can generate predictions on the test data:
```maarkdown
python src/generate_predictions.py
```
### 10. Evaluate the Model
To evaluate the model's performance, you can run:
```markdown
python src/evaluate.py
```
