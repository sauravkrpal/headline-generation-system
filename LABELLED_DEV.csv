Her extreme weight forced her to crawl instead of walk by age 11, and an ensuing stroke left her bedridden. Her family says she weighs more than 1,100 pounds, which would make her the heaviest woman aliveâ€”the current Guinness record-holder is only 643 poundsâ€”and close to the heaviest woman ever, according to the Washington Post. While Abd El Aty's weight hasn't been confirmed, Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala in India estimates she is at least 990 pounds based on photos of her. My initial reaction was 'â€˜How is she even alive?' he says. His next reaction was to try to save her. Abd El Aty is expected to arrive in Mumbai for surgery in the next 10 days, but it won't be an easy journey. In every sense, she's a challenge, Lakdawala says. The bariatric surgeon has been raising money to get her to Mumbai and will be operating pro bono, the Times of India reports. But it's not just money that's an issue. Because she can't leave her room, Abd El Aty was unable to make it to the Indian embassy to be fingerprinted for a visa; only a personal plea from Lakdawala secured her an exemption. And while transporting Abd El Aty will be challenging in its own right, Lakdawala says the surgery itself is very high risk. He says he's hopeful but not confident he can help Abd El Aty lose up to 300 pounds. (For the obese, objects are closer than they appear.)","1,100-Pound Woman to Leave Home for 1st Time in 25 Years"

But Eric Abramovitz never saw the acceptance email because then-girlfriend Jennifer Lee, a fellow music student, was spying on his account and saw it first, a court heard this week. According to Abramovitz's lawsuit, Lee, fearing she would lose him if he moved away from Montreal, posed as Abramovitz to send an email declining the offer, the Montreal Gazette reports. After deleting the original email, she then allegedly set up a fake email account in Gilad's name and sent a rejection notice to Abramovitz, who was sharing her apartment at the time. Abramovitzâ€”who finished his degree in Montreal but split up with Lee later in 2014 for unrelated reasonsâ€”ended up studying part-time under Gilad two years later and discovered the deception after the world-renowned teacher asked why he had rejected him. The student realized Lee was to blame when he correctly guessed the password to the account that had sent him the fake rejection notice. A judge in Ontario, calling Lee's conduct despicable, awarded Abramovitz $266,000, CTV reports. The judge said the figure included damages for the incompensable personal loss suffered by Mr. Abramovitz by having a closely held personal dream snatched from him by a person he trusted.

Twenty-five-year-old Joohee Han had hiked to the summit of Mount Tyson in Queensland, and took some pictures before she slipped and fell. She was knocked unconscious for five hours. When she came to, she crawled to a rocky waterfall and stayed there. She couldn't actually proceed any farther and she had no way to get back out, and that's where she stayed for days, a Queensland Ambulance flight paramedic told ABC. She didnâ€™t have food, but she had a raincoat, which kept her warm. No one at a youth hostel in Cairns where she was staying alerted authorities because Han had mentioned that after the hike she was heading out of town for the weekend. Fortunately, she had been working in Tully, south of Cairns, for a banana farmer, and one of the farmerâ€™s staff noticed that she hadnâ€™t shown up for work. The employee went looking for Han at the youth hostel, only to discover that her belongings were still there and sounded the alarm. Eventually, Hanâ€™s screams led rescuers to her location, and she was lifted out of the ravine by a helicopter. She was actually in really good condition, said the paramedic. She was in good spirits.

A family rep issued the following statement to Page Six: Mellon made his fortune in cryptocurrency, turning a $2 million investment into $1 billion. He is survived by his three children, Force, Olympia, and Minty. The family asks that their privacy be respected at this very painful time. Though the statement originally said that he died in rehab, it was updated to say he died prior to checking in. The AP reports Mellon hailed from the Mellon and Drexel families of Bank of New York Mellon and Drexel Burnham Lambert and has details on his first marriage, to Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon. The two reportedly met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting; they married in 1999, at a wedding attended by the likes of Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant. After their divorce, Mellon wed fashion designer Nicole Hanley; they split in 2015. Page Six reports Mellon spoke of his addiction issues in 2016, saying he developed a $100,000-a-month OxyContin habit after suffering an injury and was downing some 80 pills daily. The doctors kept writing prescriptions like they were Smarties, he said at the time. It's very irresponsible. OxyContin is like legal heroin. And it needs to be addressed.

A survey using electrical resistance technology has not only confirmed the existence of a tunnel running out the southern end of the Teotihuacan's 140-foot-tall Pyramid of the Moon, but also uncovered a chamber connected to it, reports Fox News. Possibly used by the Toltec peoples for funerals and other rituals, the hidden room is 26 feet beneath the pre-Aztec pyramid 30 miles northeast of Mexico City and stretches some 50 feet across. Like the tunnel, however, it has yet to be explored. As human remains, necklaces, and other apparent offerings were found inside the pyramid in the 1980s, it is not difficult to think that something similar could be found in the subsoil, archaeologist VerÃ³nica Ortega says in a release, translated from Spanish, per Science Alert. It's also believed a second tunnel awaits discovery. Archaeologists think its entrance may lie to the east of the pyramid, and they began searching that area earlier this month. The tunnel system as a whole is likely tied to a belief in the underworld: Ortega previously noted the discovery of funerary items would show the pyramid functioned, at least in part, to emulate the underworld.

The child was never found. Now, WDIV reports, a man who says he believes he's that boy has given a DNA sample to police in hopes of proving it. Police learned about the man when he posted doubts about his identity on Facebook and his belief that he was the missing D'Wan Sims, per the Detroit Free Press. He went to the Livonia police station this week to give the DNA sample. Police have contacted the mother for a DNA sample but don't know yet whether she'll provide one. She reportedly blocked the man on Facebook Messenger when he tried to contact her. In 1994, Dwanna Harris was under suspicion in the disappearance of D'Wan. She showed up on surveillance video of Wonderland Mall, but her son didn't. An officer who worked the case said this week, We looked at all of the video, we checked everything, and we never saw D'Wan. Tips poured in from the public, including one that the child was in Florida, and police conducted random searches. Harris insisted she was innocent. The only thing that I want the public to know, is that my only concern is finding my son, she said then at a press conference. Whoever has my baby, I know heâ€™s safe, and I know youâ€™re taking good care of him. ... Weâ€™ve got your Christmas ready, so, just come home, Harris said. The next step is up to Harris.

The mother of Jennifer Werstlerâ€”who died of a heroin overdose on the floor of a KFC bathroom on her 20th birthday in 2014â€”wasn't moved. You're only sorry for yourself, Margaret Werstler replied before addressing a federal courtroom in Philadelphia on Wednesday, per the Philadelphia Inquirer. Why did you â€¦ leave my child alone ... when she needed help the most? Why didn't you help save her life? Semler, 23 or 24â€”who arranged for Werstler to buy heroin, provided the syringe, and used with the friend she'd met in rehab before abandoning her as she overdosed, per the Delco Timesâ€”said she would go back and change anything if she could. She was then sentenced to 21 years in prison for causing Werstler's death. While perhaps bringing closure to Werstler's family, the decision runs afoul of addiction recovery advocates, who say addicts are being unfairly punished in an effort to combat an opioid epidemic that has killed more than 3,000 in Philadelphia in three years. Users who share drugs in deadly cases have been prosecuted under a Pennsylvania law originally intended to punish drug dealers, with critics arguing users may fail to call for help as a result. Semler, who faces six years of probation following her release, was convicted under a federal statute that carries a 20-year mandatory minimum, which the judge suggested she'd earned. But her lawyer described a woman who once used 10 bags of heroin a day transforming into a sponsor for other addicts after Werstler's death.

Sources tell Artnet that the painting was whisked away on the prince's plane and taken to his 439-foot yacht Serene. The painting's whereabouts have been unknown since 2017, when it became by far the most expensive ever sold.

The 500-year-old painting of Jesus is expected to eventually end up at a cultural hub Saudi Arabia plans to create in the Al-Ula region.

Anzorov told them he planned to film the teacher [and] make him apologize for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad], said anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard, adding that the killer said he wanted to humiliate him, to hit him. Ricard said the students hung out with Anzorov for over two hours waiting for the teacher to appear. The prosecutor added that authorities have linked the killing to an online hate campaign against the 47-year-old victim. The father of one of Paty's students is accused of launching the campaign and texting with the killer before the attack. But Ricard said the videos were innacurate because the man's daughter wasn't in Paty's two classes earlier this month, when he showed the cartoons during a lesson on free speech.

After reading about Jewish groups who tried and failed to prevent the auction from taking place, Lebanese-born Abdallah Chatila purchased 10 items that were auctioned in Germany Wednesday, and he tells the AP he spent roughly $660,000 to do so. Though his intention was initially to destroy the Nazi memorabilia so that neo-Nazis would be prevented from ever acquiring it, he decided instead to hand the items over to the Keren Hayesod-United Israel Appeal group, which he reached out to and made the offer. The itemsâ€”which include a silver-covered edition of Mein Kampf, Hitler's cigar box, and a typewriter his secretary usedâ€”will go directly from the auction house to the group. I have no direct interest whatsoever, I just thought it was the right thing to do, said Chatila, who the Times of Israel reports spent $55,300 to acquire the hat. Keren Hayesod has indicated the items may end up at the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel, which owns a number of Nazi artifacts.

Amanda Ramirez, 27, was charged with aggravated manslaughter in the death of Anna Ramirezâ€”a death that came just hours after Anna posted a photo of the twins smiling among friends on Facebook at 3:43am Saturday, reports the New York Post. Initial reports gave little in the way of details or alleged motive, but a probable cause statement released Tuesday by the Camden County Prosecutorâ€™s Office fills in some of the blanks: Police arrived at a gated apartment complex in Camden at 5:39am to find Anna on the ground with a chest wound; she died within the hour. Police say they observed bloody footprints outside Amanda's apartment, noted blood on her, and took her to the stationâ€”where they say they were told three different stories, reports NJ.com. The Washington Post cites the probable cause statement in reporting that in Amanda's original telling, she collected her twin from a main road in town and an argument followed; back at the apartment, she says Anna collapsed, bleeding. Eventually, Amanda accused her sister of going after her on the way home from a relative's house, hitting her in the face. She alleged that her sister's blow eventually took her to the ground and that Anna went inside to grab a knife. Amanda Ramirez stated she struggled with her sister for control of the knife and she ultimately stabbed her sister in the chest. Police observed cuts and scratches on Amanda's face and hands.

Relatives said a day earlier, after Murillo-Moncada finished a shift at the No Frills supermarket, he seemed disoriented and said he was hearing voices. Police believe Murillo-Moncada went to the supermarket after leaving the home, climbed on top of the freezer units, and fell into an 18-inch gap between the back of the units and the wall. Police say Murillo-Moncadaâ€”who was 5-foot-5 and weighed 140 poundsâ€”fell about 12 feet into the area where he was trapped. They say the noise of the units would have made it impossible for anyone to hear cries for help. No Frills closed the store in 2016, reports the Omaha World-Herald. Former employees say the top of the freezer units were used for storage and it was not unusual for workers to be up there.

Hu sets out to explain our attraction to the name, noting it's also the top one for dogs in New Zealand and Australia. It's been most popular among US dogs since 2009, when Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series starring Bella Swan hit peak popularity. But now that it's 2018 and it's safe to say that Twilight-mania is behind us, there must be something else going on here, Hu writes. Laura Wattenberg of Baby Name Wizard has a few ideas, noting Bella manages to be both classic and trendy, and feminine without being ultra-feminine. While hyper-masculine dog names like Tank or Diesel remain popular, names like Precious are becoming less so. Feminine markers are considered almost a pejorative, but Bella avoids that, Watternberg says. Meaning beauty in Spanish and Italian, the name conveys femininity and warmth. Like Lucy and Max, it's also classic, short, easy to say, and suits a dog of any dog breed, opposed to Curly or Patches, Watternberg tells Hu.

An international team of paleontologists has announced the discovery of the largest known dinosaur foot, which belonged to a close relative of the Brachiosaurus now dubbed Bigfoot. Appropriately so, as a nearly complete left hind-foot fossil totaling 13 bones, found two decades ago in the Black Hills area of Wyoming alongside separate and smaller brachiosaur remains, shows the 80-foot-long sauropod had feet that were about 3 feet wide, report Live Science and Gizmodo. There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet, researcher Emanuel Tschopp explains in a release. Described in journal PeerJ, this beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America. Researchers, who compared the foot to those of other dino species, believe it came from a brachiosaur that lived 150 million years ago, making it the first brachiosaur foot known to come from North America's Late Jurassic Period, per Mashable. Though it's not enough to identify a specific species, it's evidence that brachiosaurs covered a larger area of North America, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming, than previously known. This is surprising as many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas, Tschopp says. Noting the discovery occurred several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were, fellow researcher David Burnham will look to answer new questions: Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south?

Trump had said Harvard didn't need the aid since it has an endowment of nearly $40 billion, a concern that was echoed by othersâ€”even including some Harvard alums.

A summary of the final accident report released Friday said Lion Air flight 610 from Indonesia's capital Jakarta went down partly because the pilots were never told how to quickly respond to malfunctions of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet's automated flight-control system.

Hidden beneath was his darkest secret: a note providing what the Guardian calls an excruciatingly frank account of his rape of Mary Symons, a female servant in a house in which he was staying. He would eventually marry her. She was asleep but being gotten into the bed I could not easily be persuaded out again, and I confess that I did more than what was lawful or civil, but not in that manner that I ... think that she should prove with child, he wrote. I take God to witness I did not enter her body, all though I did attempt something in that nature. The note was uncovered by Paul Cook, a senior paper conservator at London's National Maritime Museum. He has worked to repair the diary over the last nine years and discovered a rewritten account had been carefully pasted over the first. It made no mention of the earlier rape. Barlowâ€”who would go on to describe his wife as obliging and ready to do any thing that should give me content â€”instead wrote that I had in part promised her at London that I would marry her â€¦ having had a little more than ordinary familiarity with her.

Per a statement given to the Daily Mail, via the New York Post, Kallestad and her pals were zipping around on mopeds when they spotted a stray puppy on the side of the road. Kallestad put the dog in her bike basket and the group went back to their resort. They all bathed and played with the puppy, which gave its new friends small bites and scratches during their playtime. Kallestad, who works at a Norwegian hospital, cleaned up her own tiny wounds but didn't think she needed any other medical help. That proved to be a fatal mistake. Soon after Kallestad returned home she started feeling ill, but she didn't tie it to her puppy interaction, and during multiple visits to the hospital, doctors weren't initially thinking rabiesâ€”until she was sick enough to be admitted full time at the Forde hospital where she worked. A physician finally suspected rabies, and tests confirmed Kallestad had the disease on Saturday. It was too late: She died Monday, eight days after she'd been admitted.

The Kansas Department of Revenue said there are 731 active registrations containing that random letter combination on standard license plates, per the AP. Vehicle owners were sent a letter dated Tuesday asking them to return the plate to their county vehicle office within 30 days for replacement at no cost. Plates not replaced within that period will be IDed in the state's system and replaced at their annual renewal. The issue arose in 2017 when Keith Kawamoto spotted a car with the Kansas plate near his Culver City, Calif., home and took a pic. The 70-year-old wrote several letters to Kansas officials, including Gov. Jeff Colyer, on the very derogatory racial slur. I don't think it should be allowed anywhere, Kawamoto said. He got an apology from the state's motor vehicles division, but he wanted the plates recalled. Kawamoto's photo was first published by the Pacific Citizen, the newspaper of the Japanese American Citizens League, and when Barbara Johnson, a 67-year-old Japanese-American from Abilene spotted his picture, it brought back childhood memories. It was not a good time to be Japanese because of Pearl Harbor and World War II, she said. I recall vividly as a child being called 'Jap'â€”and how it made me feel so small and hurt. She and her husband figured maybe they could do what Kawamoto hadn't been able to do from California: get the plates recalled and off the road. A spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Revenue said the issue came before the department's review board, which made the decision in late October to pull any current license plates with that particular lettering and restrict its use in future plates.

It was a unanimous decision Thursday, CNN notes, after the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals asked the state Supreme Court to weigh in, as state law was unclear. The ruling was in response to Brown's argument that the US Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to give juveniles mandatory life sentences without parole (a lower court noted her life sentence did include the possibility of parole), as well as that it's cruel and unusual punishment. The appeals court rejected her first argument but is still reviewing the second. Brown was 16 when she killed Johnny Mitchell Allen in 2004, a real estate agent she says solicited her for sex after she was forced to serve as a prostitute by her boyfriend, Kut Throat, HuffPost notes. She contends she shot Allen after she saw him reach for a gun; prosecutors, however, said she was trying to rob Allen, and she was tried and convicted as an adult.

Rather, Moonves carried out a personal vendetta to keep Bloodworth Thomason's shows off the network and keep her out of work for seven years right at the pinnacle of her career, she alleges. Before he took over, her shows were celebrated by CBS execs and she was given carte blanche to tackle such subjects as sexual harassment and domestic violence. Then in 1995, three years after she was given the largest writing and producing contract in the network's history at $50 million, Moonves took the reins. He proceeded to decline all of her pilots, all while keeping her hope alive that eventually something would end up on air. She doesn't know why he sidelined her, though she wonders if her shows' admittedly aggressive, feminist agenda had something to do with it.

A Baltimore County judge cited the doctrine of civil liability Thursday in rescinding the award to the family of Korryn Gaines, 23, who was killed during a six-hour standoff with police in 2016, the New York Times reports. The evidence is clear, writes Judge Mickey Norman, per CNN. This Court has found that Corporal [Royce] Ruby is entitled to qualified immunity and therefore, his shooting of Gaines was not unlawful. Qualified immunity is a doctrine maintaining that government officials on the job are protected from civil liability as long as they don't violate a person's constitutional rights. And by opening fire, Norman ruled, Ruby was only doing his job. The standoff began on Aug. 1, 2016, in Randallstown when police serving warrants for Gaines and her boyfriend say they found her with a shotgun and her 5-year-old boy, Kodi. Ruby says he fired when she raised her weapon, and kept firing when it discharged; his bullets wounded Kodi and killed Gaines. Her family disputes that account, saying she didn't raise the gun and officers were protected behind a brick wall. Either way, prosecutors declined to press criminal charges, but a civil trial granted Gaines' family the award. Now Norman has sided with the officer and relied on a doctrine that has raised concerns about police abuse, per the Times.

In a letter to customers Sunday, the 35-year-old chain said it will be business as usual during reorganization and filing for Chapter 11 protection is a deliberate and decisive step to put us on a successful track for the future. The company says, however, that it is going to close up to 178 of its 500 or so stores in the US, as well as many of its approximately 300 international locations, the AP reports. That will include all 44 stores in Canada as well as most of its locations in Asia and Europe, though the company says most of its stores in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America will remain open. Once we complete a reorganization, Forever 21 will be a stronger, more viable company that is better positioned to prosper for years to come, the company said. Analysts say the company has been struggling with changing consumer tastes and competition from online retailers. The entry of Forever 21 into Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a consequence of both changing trends and tastes within the apparel market and of missteps by the company, Neil Saunders at GlobalData Retail tells the BBC. Over the past few years, the brand has lost much of the excitement and oomph which is critical to driving footfall and sales and is now something of an also-ran which is too easily overlooked.",It's Chapter 11 for Forever 21

PG&E, facing $30 billion in liability after fatal fires sparked by its faulty equipment, filed for bankruptcy protection this year. The settlement announced Friday requires the approval of bankruptcy court. The money will go to insurers and hedge funds for coverage payments to homeowners and businesses.

The utility is still negotiating with individuals. Now we just have to get a fair amount for them, said a lawyer who represents more than 5,000 people lost their homes to the fires. PG&E agreed to pay $1 billion to local governments and state agencies in June, in a deal that brought support for its bankruptcy plan.

More than 60,000 Jews and other Holocaust victims were killed thereâ€”by gas chamber, lethal injection, exposure, starvation, or simply being shot. Rehbogen, who was at the camp from 1942 to 1944, denies knowing about the killings. But others say he had to know: Anyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives, says prosecutor Andreas Brendel. As he was under 21 at the time, Rehbogen is being tried in juvenile court in Germany and faces a possible 15-year sentenceâ€”which he likely wouldn't serve if found guilty due to his age, per the BBC.

Trump, who will speak at the memorial Thursday evening, has also ordered flyovers from Air Force One and aircraft from each branch of the military, reports the New York Times. The tanks were spotted on flatcars at a DC rail yard Tuesday before they were trucked to the National Mall. The president has described the event as a salute to the military, though critics who accuse Trump of politicizing the holidayâ€”and the militaryâ€”noted that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said the president's speech will highlight some of the administration's successes, the AP reports. After it emerged Tuesday that GOP donors had been given tickets to sit with other VIPs in a special area in front of the memorial, a Republican National Committee spokesman defended the move, saying it was standard practice for the RNC to receive a small number of tickets to events just as the DNC did under Democrat Presidents. Funding for the event is also controversial: Sources tell the Washington Post that the National Park Service is diverting around $2.5 million in park entrance fees to the event, using money that would normally have gone to park improvements. A spokeswoman for Rep.

On Wednesday, South Korean officials said they had topped the US and China, achieving the first commercial launch of a fifth-generation telecoms network after connecting to a 5G phone. AT&T and Verizon didn't take that well, Reuters reports. AT&T answered later that day, saying it already won when it announced in December that it was kicking off its 5G network in 12 US cities. However, that network can only be accessed by using a mobile hotspot device, not just a 5G phone. Verizon then argued that it was first because it has launched a 5G network that's available only on a new Motorola phone, and only in Chicago and Minneapolis. The stakes are high. The technology is billed as providing data speeds at least 20 times that of 4G and will fuel other advances like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. One estimate has it generating $12.3 trillion in annual revenue across a variety of industries by 2035. But at the moment, 5G is still more talk than reality, per the Verge. AT&T released test results showing its network is fastest, but those results could be misleading. And Verizon's rollout suffers from poor coverage.

On Wednesday, her campaign announced it pulled in $2.5 million in the first 24 hoursâ€”a record for a Democratic Senate campaign by a long shot. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee says the previous record-holder was former NASA astronaut and Arizona candidate Mark Kelly, who pulled in $1 million in his first 24 hours in February. The amount exclusively comes from online donations, which averaged $36.15. NBC News' take: The haul is a sign of just how deep Democratic antipathy toward McConnell, the Senate majority leader, runs in the Trump era. The Washington Post gives more context to her haul: Only three 2020 Democratic presidential candidatesâ€”Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Beto O'Rourkeâ€”said that they reeled in a greater amount in their first 24 hours. But McGrath's millions are just a fraction of what she'll need in what's likely to be one of the priciest Senate battles of the 2020 cycle. Politico reports McConnell had $5.5 million as of March; next week he'll report his updated tally as of the end of June. In his 2014 run, McConnell spent upward of $30 million.

CNN has more on Shakir's progressive background and the Daily Beast notes he's likely the first Muslim to run a major presidential campaign in the US.

Per Fox News, Colorado Springs police announced Wednesday that they finally found the man who murdered Jennifer Watkins over two decades ago, thanks to the help of a public genetic genealogy database. According to a Colorado Springs PD release, work with DNA collected at the scene began in earnest in 2017. That work led cold case investigators to Ricky Severt.

Severt cannot be excluded. Severt was also an employee at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, where the victim had worked as a dietary aide for just two weeks before she was sexually assaulted and killed sometime before the end of her shift in November 1999. Per the release, Severt was interviewed at the time and claimed to have never met Watkins, though his work schedule at the time did coincide with the date she was last seen.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, or HTLV-1, is considered a sexually transmitted infection since it can be spread through unprotected sex; it can also spread via blood contact and breastfeeding. It weakens the immune system and can lead to a number of serious health conditions; in up to 10% of cases, a rapidly fatal form of leukemia develops, the Guardian reports. Yet the chair of the Global Virus Network's HTLV-1 Task Force, whose lab first detected the virus in 1979, says almost nothing has been done to attempt to screen for, treat, or vaccinate against the disease. The virus is neglected, and the diseases that it causes are neglected, says another expert. HTLV-1, whose DNA can be found in Andean mummies from 1,500 years ago, is present around the world, but is highly endemic in several areas including the central Australia cluster. Indigenous communities are being hit the hardest in Australia, with a rate of prevalence that is probably the highest-ever reported ... in any population, says an expert, who notes that people in the areaâ€”including young peopleâ€”are dying from the lung condition, bronchiectasis, it can cause.

French prosecutors said a terrorism investigation was opened, though authorities did not announce a motive for the bloodshed. The city is home to the European Parliament, which was locked down after the shooting. It was unclear if the marketâ€”which was the nucleus of an al-Qaeda-linked plot in 2000â€”was targeted. The prefect of the Strasbourg region said the suspect was previously flagged as a possible extremist. The gunman has been identified and has a criminal record, according to Interior Minister Christophe Castaner; one official says he was wounded by soldiers guarding the market. Gendarmes went to the suspect's home to arrest him earlier Tuesday, before the attack, but he wasn't there, Morisse said. They found explosive materials, he said. French military spokesman Col.

People in Southwest Virginia, parts of North Carolina and West Virginia will witness the event this year, per Virginia Tech. They're harmless to humans, though cicadas pose a danger to crops and plants because they leave their eggs in branches or vines, which can then wither and split. A small tree can die if enough cicadas implant eggs in it. Owners of vineyards and orchards will want to keep an eye on the infestation, the school said. Otherwise, the main issue is noise.

The Guardian and New York Times report a $41 million, 10-year deal has been struck between trustees for the famous Roman Catholic church and the city council so that the structureâ€”whose name means holy family, per Reutersâ€”can get the licensing paperwork from the city, which it's never had, that it needs to be completed. The money paid out to the city, which People notes is the amount accrued over all these years in fees from lacking the proper permits, will help fund improvements to transportation services there. Work began on the massive church in 1882, and the Times explains that a building permit was acquired in the town it was then located in: Sant Marti de Provencals. But that town was eventually absorbed into Barcelona, and city authorities there apparently never issued a new permit. To complicate things, Antoni Gaudi, the Catalan architect behind the building's design, died in 1926 after being hit by a tram, with only about 25% of the structure complete. Officials hope that with all the red tape about to be moved out of the way, the structure, which is about two-thirds done, could be finished by 2026, the century anniversary of Gaudi's death.

Verizon and AT&T, the two biggest wireless carriers (together they hold 70% of the wireless market share) are being accused of collaborating with GSMA to keep phones locked into their network even if they're eSIM-equipped.

The BBC reports international arrest warrants have been issued for Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, and Oleg Pulatov of Russia and Leonid Kharchenko of the Ukraine. ABC News describes them as pro-Russian separatist commanders ; the Guardian offers more depth on their backgrounds, which are said to include service with Russia's FSB spy agency and the GRU, the country's military intelligence service. Girkin was reportedly commander of the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic (DNR), a self-proclaimed state in east Ukraine, when the plane was shot down. The Dutch-helmed Joint Investigation Team (JIT) says the men formed a chain linking DNR with the Russian Federation. The JIT isn't accusing the men of actually firing the Russian missile that struck the plane but believes they facilitated the missile's acquisition and transport to separatist-held eastern Ukraine. Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke says they are charged with causing the crash of MH17, leading to the death of all the people on board ... and murdering 298 passengers, per CNN. The AP reports Russian and Ukrainian laws don't allow for extradition. A trial is scheduled to begin next year, and the Guardian reports the men could be tried in absentia. Westerbeke says that in the short term we will ask Russia to hand the summons to the suspects who are in the Russian Federation and will work with Russia to set up interviews with the men. Girkin on Wednesday addressed his alleged involvement, telling the AP it isn't so. The insurgents did not shoot it down, he said.","5 Years After MH17 Was Shot Down, Murder Charges"

Human dignity was trampled upon, a judge said today, noting Cho acted as if it was her own private plane. The judge added that Cho, in custody since December, wasn't remorseful, and letters of apology submitted to the court describing her newfound humility didn't seem genuine. South Koreans are taking no small amount of glee in the downfall of the scion of one of its chaebol, or family-controlled mega-businesses often run like personal empires, reports the AP.

The killing took place Tuesday night, beginning when Svetlana Laurel went to the home of her ex-husband and used zip-ties to subdue their 12-year-old son, say police, per the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The boy told police his mother was complaining that her ex ruined her life. Soon, the ex and the daughter returned home, and Laurel allegedly zapped her ex with a Taser and zip-tied him. When the daughter ran upstairs and called 911, Laurel allegedly followed, drew a gun, and shot her daughter in the head. The dispatcher heard a voice yell, You called 911 and blow your head off, followed by a gunshot. Police say Laurel went back downstairs and tried to shoot her ex-husband, but the gun jammed. Police say he managed to shove Laurel into a wall and get the gun. That's when police arrived. During the dispute, the mother confronted the daughter, while she was on the phone with 911, and then fatally shot her, says a statement from Renton police. Initial indications are that there was a recent child custody issue where the mother had lost custody of her children. Police found the 12-year-old bound on his bed, with a sock stuffed in his mouth.

We found that 2019 was not only the warmest year on record, it displayed the largest single-year increase of the entire decade, a sobering reminder that human-caused heating of our planet continues unabated, says co-author and Penn State professor Michael Mann. More specifically, the study says 2019 average ocean temperatures were 0.135 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 1981-2019 average, which is bigger than it sounds, per NBC News. The amount of heat we have put in the world's oceans in the past 25 years equals to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom bomb explosions, says lead author Lijing Cheng. Scientists note that oceans are a strong measure of overall climate change because they take in over 90% of the heat caused by greenhouse gases. Higher ocean temperatures also melt ice, which makes sea levels rise, and endanger marine life.

He was 92, per the AP. The New York Times and Washington Post report his death was confirmed by his daughter, Janice Zima, who tells the Post his death was due to complications from prostate cancer. Volcker took charge of the Fed in August 1979, when the US economy was slipping into the grip of runaway inflation, the AP notes. Consumer prices skyrocketed 13% in 1979, and then by the same amount in 1980. The 6-foot-7-inch Volcker, who the Times notes had a reputation for austere integrity, worked relentlessly to bring prices under control. He pushed the Fedâ€™s benchmark interest rate from 11% to a record 20% by late 1980 to try to slow the economyâ€™s growth and shrink inflation. Those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily. By January 1980, a recession had begun, which lasted six months. A deeper downturn took hold in July 1981, enduring for 18 months and sending unemployment up to 10.8%, the highest since the Great Depression. In the midst of it, Volcker was vilified by the public. But the pain eventually paid off, and inflation receded. Once it did, Volckerâ€™s Fed began lowering interest rates, and the economy bounded back. After the 2008 financial crisis, President Obama recruited Volcker as an adviser.

So the men struck an agreement: Good would pay Callisch rent to house the two felines, named after characters from the animated TV show Bob's Burgers. The cats get daily visits from Callisch, who feeds and plays with them, as well as regular stop-ins from Good and Good's daughter. Callisch, who tells the Mercury News he had to install a $5,000 HVAC system for the cats, notes there are a few perks to his tenants. They don't have attitudesâ€”well, they have attitudes, but they don't talk backâ€”and they don't know who Trump is, he says. They also don't drink ... smoke ... [or] play loud music, he adds to KGO.

USA Today reports that Serina Wolfe and boyfriend Michael Crane had argued before her June 27 meal at Clear Sky Beachside Cafe in Clearwater Beach because Crane refused to pay for Wolfe's plane ticket home to Buffalo, NY, Crane says in an affidavit. Out of spite, Wolfe left a $5,000 tip on the bill, which she paid using Crane's credit card, per Pinellas County police. Craneâ€”who'd placed a temporary hold on his credit card before removing it prior to Wolfe's mealâ€”later reported the payment as fraudulent. Police say Wolfe had denied authorizing the charge when confronted by Crane, though she later confessed.

The BBC reports that the Cuvier's beaked whale turned up on the shoreline east of Davao City on Saturday, and when workers from the D'Bone Collector Museum opened up the whale's belly, they found the most plastic we have ever seen in a whale, the educational NGO said in a Facebook post. Although they're still working on documenting all the contents of the whale's belly, workers say they've so far extracted 88 pounds of plastic, including 16 rice sacks, four banana plantation-style bags, and multiple shopping bags. CNN Philippines reports the cause of death for the whaleâ€”which the New York Times notes was 15 feet long and 1,100 poundsâ€”as dehydration and starvation due to plastic ingestion. Starvation comes about because eating plastic makes the whales feel full, which leads them to eat less and not get the nutrients they need. Marine biologist Darrell Blatchley explains that the reason dehydration set in as well is because whales hydrate from the water in their food sources, not from drinking it. I was not prepared for the amount of plastic, he tells CNN, adding to the Times, The plastic in some areas was so compact it was almost becoming calcified, almost like a solid brick.

Police say a gunman entered the store with an AK-47-style rifle and opened fire just before 11am, injuring 26 others and causing general panic before giving himself up to police. Officials are considering capital murder charges for the man in custody, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, and are reading an anti-immigrant manifesto to see whether the gunman wrote itâ€”which could turn the massacre into a terrorist act or federal hate crime. Hispanics will take control of the local and state government of my beloved Texas, changing policy to better suit their needs, reads the manifesto, which says more Hispanics will make Texas a Democrat stronghold. Over 1,000 customers and 100 employees were in the store at the time, including children holding a fundraiser, who were among those shot by the gunman, the El Paso Times reports.

Kagame was speaking at an event launching 100 days of mourning 25 years after the start of the 1994 genocide, which killed around 800,000 people in 100 days, the BBC reports. An estimated 250,000 are buried at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where Kagame addressed a crowd of thousands. Kagame, the country's president since 2000, was the commander of a rebel force that helped end the slaughter. The killings began after a plane carrying President JuvÃ©nal Habyarimana, a member of the ethnic Hutu majority, was shot down on April 6, 1994. In the weeks that followed, extremist Hutu militias, assisted by the military and police, slaughtered members of the Tutsi minority, along with many moderate Hutus, the AP reports. Entire families were wiped out in an orgy of violence that killed an estimated 70% of the country's Tutsi population.

Only about 30 copies of the first edition of the Plannck I letter still exist, and one has been missing for more than 30 years after it was stolen from a library in Venice, Italyâ€”until now. Per the News Journal, the US Attorney's Office in Delaware and investigators from the Department of Homeland Security have announced the recovery of that long-lost letter, said to be worth up to $1.3 million, from a private collector. Authorities say it was taken from the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana sometime between 1985 and 1989; it wasn't seen from again until about 2005, when rare books expert Paul Needham was asked to examine it. The letter hadn't been reported missing yet, so Needham forgot about itâ€”until 2018, when he found out the letter he'd seen might be the stolen Columbus letter. He contacted authorities, and the ownerâ€”who bought the letter from a rare book dealer in 2003â€”turned it over.

This is the fourth copy of the letter to be recovered in four years: In 2016, a version was found at the Library of Congress and returned to a library in Florence, while in 2018, two other stolen copies were discovered and returned to a Spanish library and a library in Vatican City.

Former Westminster police officer Curtis Arganbright faces up to 10 years in prison on a new charge of violating the woman's civil rights, the US Attorney's Office for Colorado said Monday. The 36-year-old woman had been caught stealing medical supplies from the emergency room of Westminster's St. Anthony Hospital, where she'd arrived to be treated for chronic alcohol abuse in August 2017. However, hospital staff said they wouldn't press charges if a police officer made sure the woman got home safely, reports the Washington Post. On the ensuing ride, Arganbright pulled over, ordered the woman to pull down her pants, put her in handcuffs, and forced her to perform sex acts, according to court documents. He also allegedly warned the woman, Better not tell anyone about this, per KDVR. Investigators later found DNA evidence on the victim and Arganbright's patrol car, reports the Denver Channel. But Arganbright, originally charged with sexual assault, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of unlawful sexual contact with a woman and official misconduct and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and four years probation, per the Denver Post. With outrage mounting, the US Attorney's Office said the FBI was continuing to investigate as of July.",Cop Who Got 90 Days After Rape Allegations Not in the Clear

The department's special investigations unit discovered the problem earlier this month, and the improper conduct involved no taxpayer dollars, says Idaho Department of Correction spokesman Jeff Ray. The hand-held computer tablets, made available to Idaho inmates through a contract with CenturyLink and JPay, are popular in prisons across the country and allow inmates to email families and friends, purchase and listen to music, or play electronic games. In this case, however, a CenturyLink rep says the problem, since resolved, involved inmates intentionally exploiting a software vulnerability to increase their JPay account balances. In all, nearly $225,000 was credited into the accounts of 364 inmates at five facilities. Ray said 50 inmates credited their accounts in amounts exceeding $1,000; the largest amount credited by one inmate was just under $10,000. This conduct was intentional, not accidental. It required a knowledge of the JPay system and multiple actions by every inmate who exploited the system's vulnerability, says Ray. So far, JPay has recovered more than $65,000 worth of credits and suspended the ability of the inmates to download music and games until they compensate JPay for its losses. The inmates are still able to send and receive emails. Meanwhile, the Idaho Department of Correction has issued disciplinary offense reports to the inmates who were allegedly involved, which means they could lose privileges and may be reclassified to a higher security risk level.","Inmates Hack Tablets, Pad Accounts by $225K"

The Israeli military said most of the projectiles were intercepted, but three soldiers were wounded, raising the chances of further Israeli retaliation. One mortar shell landed near a kindergarten shortly before it opened, the AP reports. The sudden burst of violence, which stretched past midnight with no signs of slowing, follows weeks of mass Palestinian protests along the Gaza border with Israel.

Tuesday's violence bore a striking resemblance to the run-up to past wars. Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, the chief military spokesman in Israel, threatened tougher action and said it was up to Hamas to stop the situation from escalating. Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant issued a joint statement Tuesday, claiming shared responsibility for firing rockets and projectiles against Israeli communities near Gaza. They said Israel began this round of escalation by targeting their installations in the past two days, killing four militants. It was the first time the armed wing of Hamas has claimed responsibility for rocket attacks out of Gaza since the 2014 war.

A federal judge agrees in the case of Michael Cohen, approving on Friday a 90-day stay in the civil lawsuit against him and President Trump by Stephanie Clifford (aka porn star Stormy Daniels), the Washington Post reports. The reasoning: Trump's personal lawyer filed a declaration this week noting he intends to plead the Fifth in the Daniels case, as he fears answering questions in that matter could potentially implicate himself in the criminal probe against him in New York, per NPR. FBI agents working on the latter investigation carried out a raid on Cohen's home and office in early April, and because part of that mission was to seek documents related to Daniels' nondisclosure agreement, there may be large potential factual overlap with Daniels' civil case, per Otero. This is no simple criminal investigation, Otero noted Friday. Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the Court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay. Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, responded to Otero's ruling on Twitter, tweeting: While we certainly respect Judge Otero's 90 day stay order based on Mr. Cohen's pleading of the 5th, we do not agree with it. We will likely be filing an immediate appeal to the Ninth Circuit early next week. Justice delayed is justice denied.

The framed mid-'60s etching titled Burning Giraffe was on an easel at the front of Dennis Rae Fine Art's show floor, with Rasjad Hopkins, the gallery's director, working a solo shift, when the theft happened around 4:30pm Sunday, reports CBS San Francisco. Hopkins says he turned his back for just a second, and when he turned back around, the rare artwork was gone. He hadn't seen the suspect, and he tells Time that the gallery's camera wasn't on, but surveillance cameras from neighboring businesses caught a man in a blue T-shirt and hat walking away from the gallery with the etching in hand.

Police say Savage and Granzierâ€”who have more than a million YouTube subscribers between themâ€”had a drone, a computer, and camera equipment in their vehicle.

The haul was seized Tuesday from a cargo ship, the MSC Gayane, at the Port of Philadelphia, the Inquirer reported. This amount of cocaine could kill millionsâ€”MILLIONSâ€”of people, US Attorney William McSwain tweeted. Two crew members were charged with breaking federal maritime drug trafficking laws. According to court filings, the men helped haul dozens of bales of cocaine aboard from at least 14 smaller boats that approached the Gayane while going back and forth to Peru. Shipping records showed the ship arrived in port early Monday morning. One of the crew members said he was paid $50,000 to participate in the scheme, court filings show, per NBC Philadelphia.

Per Vox, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday is set to unveil legislation in support of a College for All proposal that calls for community colleges, trade schools, and public universities across the US to no longer charge tuition. But he's got what he says is another revolutionary initiative that he's pushing alongside that, reports the Washington Post: He wants to wipe out all $1.6 trillion of the country's student loan debt. In a generation hard hit by the Wall Street crash of 2008, [this plan] forgives all student debt and ends the absurdity of sentencing an entire generation to a lifetime of debt for the 'crime' of getting a college education, he says. CNN notes it will take about $2.2 trillion over 10 years to fund the debt relief and college package, and it lays out Sanders' detailed roadmap on paying for it: taxes on Wall Street, including a 0.5% tax on stock trades, a 0.1% fee on bonds, and 0.005% tax on derivatives, which all together he predicts could raise $2.4 trillion in a decade. Other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro have also pushed for student loan forgivenessâ€”but critics note Sanders' plan is inclusive for all families, including the highest-earning ones, while others' plans are more modest and geared toward the middle class and lower-income families.

One of those two men spent almost 20 years behind bars for the crimeâ€”and prosecutors now believe it was the wrong one. The AP reports Horace Roberts was released from prison Oct. 3 and fully exonerated Monday in the death of Terry Yvette Cheek, the co-worker with whom he was having an affair. Her strangled body was found alongside a highway in Riverside County, Calif., in April 1998, next to what seemed like telltale clues: Roberts' truck and a Lorus wristwatch believed to be his. Prosecutors argued he had killed Cheek after she threatened to put an end to their relationship and he was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999 and sentenced to 15 years to life. Now, prosecutors say DNA evidence indicates Cheek's husband, Googie Harris, and nephew were behind her murderâ€”and that's not all. That classic murder case quote comes from Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project, which has worked for 15 years to secure Roberts' freedom and believes Harris purposefully left behind clues that would implicate Roberts. I guess [Harris] was getting the ultimate revenge, Brooks tells the Washington Post. Roberts had lied about the affair when confronted by police, and prosecutors seized on that, even though he had an alibi for the night: He called Cheek a number of times from a pay phone near his house when she didn't show up as she was supposed to. DNA tests performed on the watch and Cheek's fingernails in 2013 and 2017 were key to Roberts' exoneration. Harris and Joaquin Leal are being held on $1 million bail.

At a Friday presser, Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn and Sacramento County DA Anne Marie Schubert said Roy Charles Waller, 58, was arrested Thursday as he showed up to work at UC Berkeley, per the Sacramento Bee. Waller is suspected of committing at least 10 rapes across six different counties between 1991 and 2006. Detective Avis Beery, who's been working the case for more than a decade, tells the Washington Post that the rapist's typical M.O. was to sneak into women's houses (said to usually be Asian women) while they were sleeping, overpower them, and bind them before assaulting them. Sometimes the women would be forced to withdraw money at an ATM, while other times the suspect would simply take things from their homes before he fled. What finally broke the case open: a genealogy website. Investigators pieced together Waller's ID in record-setting time by plugging in DNA from the rapist's crime scenes into GEDmatchâ€”the same site used to find Golden State Killer suspect Joseph James DeAngelo. A fairly close match popped up, and from there the sleuths built a family tree that led them to Waller, who matched up with the rapist's age and weight descriptions. Public records also showed Waller had lived in or near the locations where the rapes occurred. After acquiring Waller's DNA via at least one discarded sample, investigators were able to make a match with the crime scene DNA. I have often said in my career that DNA is the silent witness to the truth, Schubert said at the presser.

And loan demand among farmers is historically high, Sonny Perdue added, per Reuters. Low interest rates and stable land prices have masked the problem, he said. Still, farm debt has been rising more rapidly over the last five years, increasing by 30% since 2013. The government does worry about a drop in farmland prices, an economist said last week, but has seen no signs of that yet. In the '80s, low crop prices helped cause farmers to fall behind on high-interest loans on land and equipment. This time, per Reuters, the causes include low commodity prices, storm damage to crops, and trade disputes that have closed export markets. To ease farmers' losses from the trade battles, the Trump administration has promised as much as $12 billion in aid. More than $8 billion has been paid so far, Perdue said, but there's no aid package planned for this year.

The incident happened Sunday evening in the Gulf of Oman, causing the martyrdom of a number of brave members of the naval forces, the navy said in a Monday statement cited by the BBC. Per Iranian media, the 155-foot Konarak was placing targets for other ships in the waters near the Strait of Hormuz and didn't get far enough away from one when it was hit by a C-802 Noor anti-ship cruise missile fired by the frigate Jamaran. Per the Guardian, the navy's statement upped the original reported number of fatalities, which had originally been noted by Iranian state media as being at least one sailor dying. The paper added that the media in Iran doesn't typically comment on training exercise accidents, indicating how serious this particular one must've been. The Drive has pictures of the damaged Konarak, which saw its entire upper structure obliterated. A video put out by Iranian state media also allegedly shows the Konarak after the hit, black smoke billowing from its destroyed body.

Knox Robinson spent time with Kipchoge at his rural training camp in Kenya, and in an extensive piece for GQ, Robinson explains: His secret is that there are no secrets. You just put in the work, season after season. Kipchoge runs six days a week at the camp where he also lives, spending brief weekend visits with his wife and three young kids and working their farm. He simply puts in the miles, and it worksâ€”and after his visit to the camp, Robinson did the same, running 100 miles a week and adopting the communal ethos of the Kenyan camp. Robinson's Brooklyn running team started training and eating together, and ended up sending more than 20 runners to the Berlin Marathon. Half ran personal bests. The idea that you can do more by working in harmony might be obvious to any middle school basketball player, but in a world where the default mindset is The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner, it was a foreign concept, Robinson writes. With that shift in our mentality, we started to see results. Of course, Kipchoge's story isn't 100% feel-good; Robinson notes there are detractors who decry his use of a 41-person pace team or a Nike prototype shoe not yet available to the public. That became the irony of sub-2:00: that the most modest of champions, a man who sleeps in a twin bed, drives an Isuzu pickup, and milks his own cows, became the focus of a debate about how relentless innovation complicates the ethics of the world's simplest sport, Robinson writes. But amid all the talk about pacers and Alphaflys, it was easy to forget what it was that got Kipchoge into the ballpark of two hours in the first place: spending six days a week for nearly two decades in his camp's monastic seclusion.

They didn't know, reports the Washington Post, but as the ones asked to do the study they could put a figure on what's still pouring out of the site all this time later: as many as 4,578 gallons daily. The oil platform was located in an underwater canyon some 12 miles from Louisiana and leased by the Taylor Energy Companyâ€”which claims just 3 gallons are seeping out daily. Monster waves churned up by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, triggered an undersea mudslide that took down the platform and more than two dozen well pipes, which were buried in more than 100 feet of sediment. Taylor Energy claims the oil is seeping out of the oil-soaked sediment. The report commissioned by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement found the oil is coming from a number of wells. The AP explains nine wells were capped by Taylor Energy, but the company has maintained it's more environmentally prudent to leave 16 of them buried than try to cap them. Gizmodo puts the new numbers in context, reporting they make for a cumulative spill of 25 million gallons; the Deepwater Horizon Spill was more than six times bigger, at 168 million gallons. The Weather Channel reports news of the former spill only publicly emerged in 2010, as scientists discovered it while looking into the latter spill; no coastal environmental damage has been reported.

Further cementing the city's reputation as the most expensive in the country, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has revamped income limits so that a family of four earning $117,400 a year now qualifies as low income in San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties, while a household income of $73,300 is considered very low income, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Not only is the low-income gauge the highest such limit in the country, but it represents a 10% increase over last year, per the San Jose Mercury News.

The child's battered body was found in a forest in January, a week after she went missing while grazing her family's ponies. Police say the accused men planned the child's kidnapping for over a month as part of a plan to scare her Muslim nomadic tribe away from the area. Police said the child was sedated and held captive at a Hindu temple where she was repeatedly raped before being strangled and bludgeoned to death.

The Pew Research Center reposted that fact Friday with the latest Facebook news: The site has discovered a breach that affected about 50 million users, reports the New York Times. The company says the problem has been fixed and it was still assessing just how serious it was, but the personal information of those users was exposed. In a blog post, the company said it's clear that attackers exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code that impacted 'View As,' a feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else. That, in turn, let the hackers get their hands on what are called access tokens â€”basically, digital keys â€”to hijack people's accounts. The company says it has temporarily turned off the View As feature while it looks into things. It has also reset the access tokens, which meant about 90 million people had to log back onto Facebook or its other apps that use the Facebook login. Facebook says it's not yet sure who the hackers are, where they attacked from, or how big the attack really was. The company says no one has to change their passwords as a result of this attack.

A colony of 25 endangered short-haired chinchillas has made a home at the site now under development by Gold Fields, as Ed Stoddard writes at Undark. To secure the deal, the South African-based gold mining company had to agree to trap and move the 25 animals previously hunted to near-extinction, which are protected under Chilean law. The project is seen as a test of how mining companies will respond to increasing pressure to limit environmental impacts, and it will be both pricey and time-consuming, stretching on for nine months from August. Some $400,000 has already been spent on non-lethal traps and population surveys. Then again, gold reserves at the mine, to be competed in 2024, are worth nearly $7 billion, per Mining.com. Experts will eventually attempt to capture the chinchillas in nine rocky areas over 10 days. If they're unsuccessful, the project will be halted for 20 days, to minimize disturbance, before the next 10-day attempt. The chinchillas will then be moved to 2.5 miles to a new habitat where a wire-mesh enclosure will protect them for a few weeks. They'll also be monitored with radio collars. But success isn't guaranteed. A 2015 study found mixed results in an effort to relocate the American pika, a chinchilla-like mammal that lives in the mountains, in the 1970s, Stoddard writes. It will be no fun for the chinchillas and mortality/death is possible, wildlife biologist Curtis Bosson tells Stoddard.

The remains of four of the men were found in Northern California's Plumas National Forest that summer; the fifth was never found. Why the men were there at all, what befell them, and whether that fifth man might have been involved has remained the stuff of mystery for more than four decades. In a two-part series for the Sacramento Bee, Benjy Egel was given access to police evidence and spoke to people associated with the case to paint a picture of what certainly happenedâ€”and what might have. They were driving home from a Chico State basketball game when they went missing. The men, who ranged in age from 24 to 30, were described as mentally disabled, but that wasn't quite right in regards to one of them. Gary Mathiasâ€”the one whose body was never foundâ€” was an aberration, a man who didn't have an intellectual disability but was schizophrenic, violent, and frequently in trouble with the law. The group, who had all met at a program for adults with special needs, was last seen buying snacks in Chico. Their car was found Feb. 28 at the forest's snow line, with gas still in it. In June, Ted Weiherâ€™s body was found inside a remote trailer used by the forest service. His beard growth indicated he'd been alive for as many as six weeks. Cans of food had been eaten from a storage locker, but a second locker went unopened. Mathias' sneakers were inside; Weiher's sturdier shoes were gone. Three more bodies were found within days, one nearby, two not. Egel writes it's possible Mathias too fell victim [to] inexplicable circumstances, or that he went off his meds to be sharper for the next day's game and inadvertently brought his friends out to their deaths on a schizophrenia-induced adventure.

That's according to a recent paper based on data crunched by a supercomputer in Tennessee, Medium reports. Earlier this year, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory analyzed 17,000 genetic samples in an effort to better comprehend the disease. Researchers pored over the results and confirmed a previously floated theoryâ€”that COVID-19 can be explained by its effect on bradykinin, a body chemical that usually helps regulate blood pressure. There was a Sunday afternoon eureka moment just staring at the data, lead researcher Daniel Jacobson told Forbes in August. The virus seems to trigger a domino effect that spikes bradykinin levels, which then cause blood vessels to leak. That would fill lungs with fluid; create seizures, stroke, delirium, and dizziness; and possibly create low blood pressure and arrhythmias, all of which have occurred in COVID-19 patients. The researchers say COVID-19 boosts bradykinin by altering a hormone system called the reninâ€“angiotensin system, or RAS. We've been very interested in the RAS pathways because coronaviruses so often target them, says Jacobson. Luckily there are drugs that affect the RAS, including danazol and stanozolol; vitamin D also helps. The researchers are calling for clinical trials to test these approaches.

Spurlock has gone from being an avid Big Mac consumer in Super Size Me to serving his own fast-food chicken sandwiches in Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!â€”a sober look at an industry that processes 9 billion animals a year in America. Ironically, Spurlock's film about fast-food chicken reemerges during a food feud over fried-chicken sandwiches, with the nation obsessed with a Popeyes version. The documentary was released Friday and is already available for streaming, Today reports. In it, Spurlock sets up his own chicken farm to raise chickens that will then be used at his own fast-food restaurant, Holy Chicken. Today notes that among the truths the film exposes is the fact that in order for chicken to be labeled free range, it need only have access to a tiny outdoor space. The label does not necessarily mean the chicken actually roamed outside. Spurlock, attempting to recreate this condition in the film, actually had to chase his chickens to get them to even approach the door; they were too large to feel like being active in the hot outdoors. Spurlock says the movie also reveals how poorly chicken farmers are treated by Big Chicken.

For that matter, the show probably hasn't won the hearts of many in upstate New York either, thanks to the same episode. The most heat is in Canada, particularly Newfoundland. As the CBC recounts, one joke in particular hit hard: When Lisa tells a group of Canadians that I'm sure you treat all peoples equally, one replies, Except the QuÃ©bÃ©cois. And the Newfies. Stupid Newfies. Then Ralph Wiggum is seen saying, I'm a Newfie! and clubbing a stuffed seal. The first offense is the use of Newfie, widely seen as derogatory. The second is the seal-hunting dig, called a cheap shot and false information by the owner of a clothing store that sells sealskin clothing. Another response, from Canadian comic Mark Critch: (I'm) not upset about the â€˜newfieâ€™ joke ... so much as surprised that in all my 45 years, the lamest, least-interesting â€˜Newfieâ€™ joke Iâ€™ve heard was on @thesimpsons, he wrote. Still, the joke was nothing compared to the scathing treatment of Buffalo, Rochester, and other upstate New York cities, which the Simpsons traveled through on their way to Canada. It's the one place that can never decline because it was never that great, declares Homer, who sings a mocking ode, per CNN. Included: The Kodak plant's closed, but I'm a-longin' to stay/And go on disability in upstate New York/Can't make it anywhere but I can make it there. In response, the state fair wants the show's writing staff to visit, reports WIVB, and the governor's office wants people to know that unemployment is down and millennials are coming back.","After 1 Simpsons Episode, Angry Viewers in 2 Countries"

Rush's Neil Peart, who the CBC notes was revered by fans and fellow musicians as one of the greatest drummers of all time, passed away Tuesday at age 67 in Santa Monica, Calif., per a statement issued by a family spokesperson, after being diagnosed with brain cancer more than three years ago. The Canadian band, made up of fellow members Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, announced his death Friday afternoon on social media with broken hearts and the deepest sadness, asking fans who wanted to help to make a donation to a cancer charity or research group. Peart was also behind much of the lyrics for the band's songsâ€”which NBC News notes were heavily influenced by science fiction, philosophy, and classic literature â€”and was known for the elaborate drum and percussion setup that surrounded him as he performed. Peart started drumming as a teen after getting a pair of sticks, a practice pad, and lessons, he said in a 2005 interview. He teamed up with Lee and Lifeson in 1974, and Rush soon attracted a worldwide following, selling millions of records. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994, and into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Peart's death brought reaction from big names in music and politics. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted that we've lost a legend, while fellow Canadian rocker Bryan Adams offered his own condolences. Paul Stanley of Kiss and Slash of Guns N' Roses also had messages to share. Rest in peace brother, Rush's statement ended. Peart is survived by his wife, Carrie, and his daughter Olivia.

The president met with and praised police, while the former vice president met with the family of George Floyd. As the Los Angeles Times sees it, Trump looks intent on pushing a law-and-order message while portraying Biden and Democrats as radicals who would abolish police departments. We wonâ€™t be defunding our police, Trump said, per the Guardian, referring to the push to redirect money from police departments. There wonâ€™t be dismantling of our police. Biden, meanwhile, met for an hour in private with members of the Floyd family in Houston. He listened, heard their pain and shared in their woe, said family attorney Benjamin Crump. That compassion meant the world to this grieving family. However, the contrast isn't so simple. Biden also pushed back against the idea of defunding the police, a phrase with multiple meanings. He did, though, call for reform. No, I donâ€™t support defunding the police, he told CBS News. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. A spokesman said that Biden not only opposes cuts in police funding, he thinks increases might be necessary for improvements. In short, he has begun walking a cautious line between the moderate and more drastic demands for overhauling police departments, per the New York Times.

In a post at Medium detailing the proposal, Warren says the increased benefits would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy. The plan comes out hours ahead of the third Democratic debate, and the New York Times observes that it appears calculated to appeal to older voters who might be leaning toward Joe Biden. Warren's plan would cost more than $150 billion in its first year, per the Times. Specifically, Warren wants to impose a new 14.8% contribution requirement on individual wages above $250,000 a year, reports the Hill. Currently, the rich contribute a far smaller portion of their income to Social Security than everyone else, writes Warren. That's wrong, and it's threatening the solvency of the program. She maintains that her plan would not only result in a needed raise for beneficiaries, whose average monthly check is $1,354, but would extend the solvency of Social Security by two decades. The chances of her plan becoming reality? Pretty slim, notes Vox in an explainer. But Warrenâ€™s Social Security pitch is a good guide to how she thinks about economic policy in general, writes Matthew Yglesias. Her emphasis is on income inequality and how to remedy that.

A $100 refundable payment comes with each preorder, the Verge reports, which means the company has already collected $14.6 million for the electric pickup. Production won't begin until 2021. Musk tweeted Saturday that that success happened with no advertising & no paid endorsement â€” though of course there was media coverage of the event at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

Devised in Australia, the test uses a color-changing liquid and a new cancer-detection approach that could help people pre-screen before having more thorough tests. A major advantage of this technique is that it is very cheap and extremely simple to do, so it could be adopted in the clinic quite easily, says study co-author Laura Carrascosa. The test is simple: A patient's DNA is placed in water containing gold nanoparticles. DNA from cancer cells will cling to the gold, making the water's color stay pink; if the cells are healthy, they bind differently and make the water turn blue, per the Smithsonian. We certainly don't know yet whether it's the holy grail for all cancer diagnostics, but it looks really interesting and doesn't require a biopsy or complicated equipment, says team leader Matt Trau. Sadly, it can't spot the size or location of a tumor, and its 90% success rate is furrowing at least one brow: What if you had cancer and you were one of the 10% whose true cancer was not detected? writes Gary Schwitzer at Health News Review.

Sperling had suffered a lengthy illness, according to the South Florida Reporter. As a Mental Floss article explained in 2018, Sperling was 26 and had been losing his hair for years when, depressed over his recent divorce, he first had the idea for his businessâ€”he had tried a toupee, a weave, a combover, and wasn't happy with the results. He ended up marrying againâ€”a hairstylistâ€”and together they came up with a nylon mesh fitted to the scalp, to which human hair strands could be woven, but which allowed any of the client's original hair to continue growing. The system solved one of Sperling's main complaints about toupees: It stayed in place during sex, exercise, and even showering. Sperling eventually realized he needed to advertiseâ€”his customers, after all, weren't exactly eager to talk about their hair replacement to their friends. And thus the famous slogan was born. In the first commercial, which aired in 1982, customers gave testimonials; it didn't get a lot of attention.

Miserable because it's, well, exhausting. Last October, Boswell flew from DC to Los Angeles to DC to LA to St. Louis to DC to Houston to DC to Houston to DC, writing 21 columns and a book chapter. More words were left on the cutting room floor due to late changes in the game. Rip up, start again â€”that's a guarantee in baseball. You return to your hotel room between 2 and 4am, often after writing multiple versions of your story, including one for the print paper, Boswell notes. And you wonder how stories on games that end at 1am get in the paper on your doorstep at 6am. So where's the marvelous part? He explains: You canâ€™t plan out World Series stories ahead of time. You can do homework to prep, can come up with story ideas or themes. But baseball usually blows them up. World Series reality makes surrealism seem boring. That creates a situation where you don't know where the words you are writing are coming from or what will come next. You give yourself over totally to the moment and to blind trustâ€”what's the alternative?â€”in yourself, he writes. Sometimes, you'll finish with tears on your face, he adds. You may say, 'It's only baseball,' and you'd be right. But I suspect that creativity, whether the scale is miniature or masterpiece, feels a little bit similar.

During the years in question, Trump's core businesses, including hotels and casinos, lost a total of $1.17 billion and he posted bigger losses than almost any other individual American taxpayer, according to the transcripts. The Times reports that according to the annual IRS sampling of high-income earners, Trump posted losses of more than $250 million in 1990 and 1991, more than double those of any other taxpayer listedâ€”and because of the losses, Trump only paid income tax in two of the 10 years in question.

The newspaper says it did not obtain Trump's actual tax returns, but obtained printouts of the official IRS tax transcripts from someone who had legal access to them. Trump lawyer Charles Harder tells the Times that the information is highly inaccurate, though the newspaper says similar transcripts for Trump's father, Fred Trump, match his tax returns. The Times notes that Trump was able to keep up his billionaire lifestyle despite the losses because most of the money belonged not to him, but to banks and investorsâ€”and because he secretly leaned on his father's wealth to continue living like a winner.

Chizuo Matsumoto, also known as Shoko Asahara, was the head of Aum Shinrikyo, the group responsible for the 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on Tokyo subway lines that killed 13 and injured more than 6,000 as well as other murders and other nerve gas attacks, one of which killed eight. Thirteen members of the cult had been sentenced to death; six are still awaiting execution. Japan does not carry out executions until all associated cases have been closed, with no more appeals pending; that happened in January, the BBC reports. Matsumoto, 63, had been imprisoned 22 years; his case was finalized in 2006, CNN reports. Matsumoto founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984, and at its peak in the 1990s the cult had more than 10,000 members in Japan and thousands more in other countries; a successor group still has 1,500 members in Japan. The group's scientists produced nerve gas at its commune at the foot of Mount Fuji as Matsumoto, who claimed to be a messiah, preached what the Guardian describes as a bizarre mix of Buddhist and Hindu meditation along with Christian and apocalyptic teachings, yoga, and the occult. There were reports of brainwashing and abuse in the cult, and after the 1995 attack dozens of followers were rounded up in police raids. Per the Japan Times, Matsumoto never offered an explanation for the group's crimes.

Beyond the lives and family fortunes lost, it had far-reaching repercussions, contributing to generations of black distrust of white authority.

The deal also is the latest chapter in Morgan Stanley's transformation from a scrappy, deal-doing, stock-trading investment bank to a more well-rounded financial firm now more reliant on its asset and wealth management businesses. According to the terms of the all-stock deal, E-Trade shareholders will receive 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each share they own. E-Trade CEO Mike Pizzi will continue to run the firm once it becomes a division within Morgan Stanley, per the AP. Morgan Stanley will acquire E-Trade's 5.2 million customer accounts with $360 billion in assets as part of the merger. Under CEO James Gorman, Morgan Stanley has shifted into new, more universal financial services that can bring in steady revenue when the more traditional parts of the bank's businessâ€”trading and advising clientsâ€”slow down or suffer in difficult markets. The strategy has worked: Morgan Stanley's income has been less volatile, and the bank has been consistently hitting its profitability goals; the bank had record profits last year. E-Trade represents an extraordinary growth opportunity for our wealth management business and a leap forward in our wealth management strategy, Gorman said in a prepared statement Shares of Morgan Stanley fell 3.7% before the market open, while E-Trade's stock surged 24.1%.

Now, with six new cases on the books, the Chinese city where the pandemic began is taking steps to prevent a new outbreak, starting with plans to test all 11 million of its residents. The BBC reports that, after more than two months under lockdown, the city started reopening on April 8 after it stopped seeing any new cases. Then, an elderly man was found Sunday to have the virus, followed by five others from the same housing complex. CNN notes none of those cases is believed to have come from outside the city. Now, per an internal document, each district in the city has been told to come up with its own plan by noon Tuesday for a 10-day battle, in which it will need to test all residents in that time period. The document stresses that older residents and communities that are more crowded should get first priority. An assistant professor at Yale's School of Public Health tells the Global Times that such wide-scale testing is necessary to get a handle on transmission in China's densely packed cities. Some infectious disease experts think the mass testing is either unnecessary or undoable, either due to cost or logistics. Other experts, however, tell the paper that by testing everyone, residents will have peace of mind, which will expedite the return to work and school. Plus, because between 3 million and 5 million residents have already been tested, the city would only need to test the 6 million to 8 million who hadn't been in 10 daysâ€”between 600,000 and 800,000 a day.

Allan Glaser, Hunter's romantic partner for more than 30 years, confirmed his death of a heart attack caused by a blood clot, calling his passing unexpected and sudden, per the Hollywood Reporter. Born in 1931 as Arthur Andrew Kelm, Hunter's stage name was brainstormed by talent agent Henry Willson, who also repped Rock Hudson. His blond surfer image nabbed him magazine covers and the role of Washington Senators star Joe Hardy in 1958's Damn Yankees.

Hunter appeared alongside Divine in John Waters' Polyester in 1981, as well as in 1985's Lust in the Dust, which also co-starred Divine. Although he was often seen out and about with Natalie Wood, Sophia Loren, and other big-name actresses, Hunter had a relationship with Anthony Perkins, and he confirmed he was gay in his 2005 autobiography.

Andrew Cuomo announced the results of the tests Thursday, in which 3,000 people at grocery stores and other shopping sites in 19 counties were checked for antibodies, CNBC reports. The tests showed 13.9% overall had them, which would translate to possibly 2.7 million people in the state. The highest infection rate was in New York City, at more than 21%. Cuomo had said the FDA-approved test would give officials the first true snapshot of how widespread the disease is. Having the antibodies doesn't mean a person has immunity; the World Health Organization said last week that the tests don't indicate whether a person is now safe from COVID-19. If New York's results are indicative of infection rates, it would mean the number of cases is far higher than officials had thought; 250,000 cases in the state have been confirmed. But Cuomo said it would also mean that the fatality rate is as low as about 0.5%, per the New York Times. The sample wasn't completely random, Cuomo conceded, which makes drawing firm conclusions difficult. People out shopping could be exposed to the virus more than people at home, but then, they evidently were healthy enough to be out shopping. What does it mean?

Making matters worse was a scare on Sunday that a second mine dam was about to breach, sending 24,000 people to higher ground while civil engineers checked everything out. That dam was eventually deemed to be OK, but the New York Times notes the entire situation underscores possible oversight issues with Brazil's mining industry.

Reindl wrote on a Facebook fundraiser that her son suffered seven skull fractures requiring multiple surgeries, and that doctors were detecting no brain activity over several days.

The $7.3 billion fund, which opened in 2011 and is set to expire in December 2020, has faced a surge in new claims as it winds down. Pending claims will be paid at 50%, while any claims filed after Feb. 1 will be paid at 30%. I am painfully aware of the inequity of the situation, says fund administrator Rupa Bhattacharyya. But the stark reality of the data leaves me no choice. If there had been a different option available to me, I assure you I would have taken it. The numbers are pretty dire: The fund has paid out about $5 billion to 21,000 people; another 19,000 claims remain unpaid. A 235% surge in claims since December 2015 isn't necessarily due to a race to cash in before the fund closes, so much as cancer latency periods and what Bhattacharyya says is a lack of a good estimate of how many potential claimants there are, partly because there's never been a good estimate of how many people were exposed.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that the district had reached a deal with the Chicago Teachers Union after months of unsuccessful negotiations led to the city's first significant walkout by educators since 2012. The union's 25,000 members went on strike Oct. 17, holding marches and rallies across the city. Chicago Teachers Union delegates voted late Wednesday to approve a tentative deal, but they initially refused to end the strike unless the mayor added school days to cover the lost time. The union said Lightfoot had agreed to make up five days of lost time. The school district said classes will resume Friday. Teachers said the strike was based on a social justice agenda and aimed to increase resources, including nurses and social workers for students, and reduce class sizes, which teachers say currently exceed 30 or 40 students in some schools. Union leaders said the strike forced the city to negotiate on issues they initially deemed out of bounds, including support for homeless students. The strike was another test of efforts by teachers' unions to use contract talks typically focused on salaries and benefits and force sweeping conversations about broader problems. The agreement approved on Wednesday was not immediately released but Sharkey said some of teachers' wins could transform schools in the district. The full union membership still must hold a final vote on the agreement.

Marks was convicted of defrauding five clients for amounts ranging from $2,655 to $153,400 each; she had pleaded guilty to felony theft in February, NBC Washington reports.

The seven hours were split between six visits in May, during which de Blasio participated in two meetings, four events, and five phone calls, reports the New York Post, citing entries on his official calendar. Whether at City Hall, Gracie Mansion or on the road, the mayor consistently delivers for 8.6 million New Yorkers, a spokeswoman says. A former aide counters, If he's trying to show New Yorkers that he's over doing the job, heâ€™s doing a good job of it. Days earlier, comedians Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler jokingly renamed City Hall Park as Iowa in the hope of drawing de Blasio back to the office. People could come to 'Iowa' to tell you how tired they are of the city's crumbling subway system or you could address the lack of affordable housing in New York City from right here in 'Iowa,' Stiefler said, per the New York Daily News.

Per Sky News, Police in Worcester say someone deliberately threw a caustic substance in the boy's face and arm while he was with his family in a Home Bargains store. The shocking attack happened Saturday, after which West Mercia Police distributed stills from CCTV footage taken inside the store. The three men cops say are pictured in the photos have since been arrested. BBC reports that at least one of the men has been charged in connection with the attack. The 39-year-old man faces a count of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Authorities said it remains unclear if the boy's injuries will cause lasting harm to his health, but one official called the attack horrific, not least of all because of the area's low crime rate. A motive for the attack was immediately unclear, though authorities confirmed the injuries were consistent with burns caused by a chemical acid or base.

Mohamed Toure and Denise Cros-Toure, both 58, could be deported to their native Guinea as a result of Monday's decision, which also requires that they pay $288,000 in restitution to victim Djena Diallo, reports Dallas News. The pair were convicted of forced labor and alien harboring in January after prosecutors said the girlâ€”now living near Houstonâ€”was brought to Southlake in 2000, then forced to cook, clean, and take care of the couple's children without pay. The New York Times reports Diallo began work at age 5, though Dallas News describes her exact age as unclear, noting she'd previously spent two years as a maid for Cros-Toure's father. He's a former secretary of state in Guinea, while Toure's father was president for 26 years. All the while, Diallo was choked, whipped, and called a dog and worthless, per CNN.

In what USA Today says is the first study using a nationally representative sample to look at how low-level lead exposure is tied to deaths in the US, scientists kept tabs on more than 14,000 adults who took a national health survey between 1988 and 1994, then again in 2011. After looking at how many people died during this periodâ€”about 4,400 in total, 1,800 of those from cardiovascular diseaseâ€”the study in the Lancet Public Health journal found about 256,000 deaths each year could be tied to lead exposure. The effects of lead on heart health had previously been thought to be much lower, especially at low levels of lead exposure, study lead author Bruce Lanphear tells CNN. Dr. Philip Landrigan, a Mount Sinai epidemiologist not involved with the study, explains that leadâ€”which can show up in old water pipes, paint in older homes, industrial sites, plane fuel, and even certain foodsâ€”damages blood vessels' epithelial cells, which then ups the risk of plaque building up, possibly leading to a heart attack. The scientists also looked at all kinds of deaths, not just ones caused by heart disease, and found lead was tied to more than 410,000 US deaths annuallyâ€”about 10 times more than what was previously believed to be the case, and not far off from the 480,000 smokers who die each year. The good news: Today's lead-exposure levels are much lower, meaning the next generation should hopefully see a lower death rate linked to lead.

A week later, it reached 1 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Almost a quarter of the casesâ€”and 6,000 of the more than 53,000 COVID-19 deathsâ€”are in the US. The true number of cases worldwide is believed to be higher, since some countries are suspected of concealing the extent of outbreaks and others lack testing capacity, the Guardian reports. Brendan Murphy, Australia's chief medical officer, said Thursday that he suspects the real figure is 5 million or 10 million worldwide. The only numbers I have total faith in are the Australian numbers, frankly, he said. Some 56% of the confirmed COVID-19 deaths worldwide are in Italy, Spain, and France, the three hardest-hit countries in Europe, the AP reports. In Spain, which has recorded more than 10,000 deaths, there was a glimmer of hope that the outbreak may have peaked when 932 deaths were reported Fridayâ€”down slightly from the record set the day before.

DEV_1_573,"(Jun 5, 2020 1:28 PM CDT) Research already has suggested that men face a greater risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Now, scientists say male pattern baldness might actually be a risk factor, reports the Telegraph. We really think that baldness is a perfect predictor of severity, says Brown University's Carlos Wambier, lead author of two small studies in Spain. The first study of 41 men admitted to Spanish hospitals with COVID-19 found 71% had male pattern baldness, which is estimated to affect 31% to 53% of white men. The second study of 122 men admitted to three Madrid hospitals with COVID-19 found 79% had male pattern baldness, reports Science. As male pattern baldness is linked to dihydrotestosteroneâ€”an androgen, or so-called male sex hormoneâ€”the thought is that androgens may boost the virus' ability to penetrate cells. There is other evidence in support of this theory. For instance, a study of 42,000 men with prostate cancer in Veneto, Italy, found patients on androgen-deprivation therapyâ€”drugs that reduce levels of androgens that fuel prostate cancer cellsâ€”were significantly less likely to fall ill, be hospitalized, or die of COVID-19 than men with prostate cancer who were not taking the drugs. These results are replicated in a second, still-unpublished study, whose author believes androgen deprivation may limit those severe outcomes, per Science. A US trial is already underway to see if drugs that treat male pattern baldness (by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone) are effective at treating COVID-19. Another study of 200 veterans in Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York will analyze the effect of prostate cancer drugs, per the Telegraph.",New Risk Factor for COVID-19: Baldness?

Corona died Monday at an undisclosed hospital, Vicky Waters of the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported. He had been serving a life sentence in state prison, the AP reports. A labor contractor who hired thousands of fruit and vegetable workers for Northern California farmers, Corona killed 25 of them, according to authorities who arrested him in 1971. The bodies were buried in shallow graves on farms and orchards along the Feather River north of Sacramento. Most had been brutally hacked to death and dismembered, possibly with a machete or meat cleaver. One was shot in the head. He was arrested after a peach farmer who had contracted with him for hired pickers became suspicious upon finding a hole that had been freshly dug, then filled in. Authorities found the body of a man whose head had been cleaved open and his torso riddled with stab wounds. Nine more bodies were recovered in another orchard five days later, along with receipts made out to Corona, who was immediately arrested. He was convicted of 25 counts of murder in 1973, the most until John Wayne Gacy of Chicago was convicted of 33 in 1980. An appeals court overturned Corona's conviction in 1978, ruling he had received incompetent representation from his attorney, but he was ultimately convicted again on all 25 counts.

Presleyâ€”who is reportedly $16 million in debtâ€”argues her fortune was lost because Barry Siegel failed to alert her to inappropriate spending (on expensive homes, mainly) and made a bad investment, reports TMZ. After selling 85% of Presley's shares in Elvis Presley Enterprises for $100 million in 2005, Siegel invested in Core Entertainment, the parent company of American Idol, according to Presley. When the company went bankrupt more than a decade later, Presley says she lost $24.5 million. In a countersuit, Siegel tells a very different story. The 2005 sale of Presley's shares cleared up over $20 million in debts Lisa had incurred and netted her over $40 million cash and a multi-million dollar income stream, most of which she managed to squander in the ensuing years, Siegel's attorney says, per the New York Daily News. She refused to listen to the warnings of her most trusted advisers and her family and eventually stopped paying Siegel, according to the suit. She is looking to blame others but has only herself to blame for her financial and personal misfortunes, it adds. As part of proceedings for her divorce from Michael Lockwood, Presley has claimed she owes $10 million in unpaid taxes, $6 million from the purchase of a UK home, and $500,000 in other unpaid fees, per Us Weekly.

Only three of these vehicles were built, and just one survives to this day, so when it was announced that RM Sotheby's was putting it up for auction, the automotive aficionado world lit up, with predictions the car would go for as much as $20 million. But a current glimpse at the auctioneer's website after Saturday's much-hyped event shows a still for sale notice, the result of what Jalopnik calls a weird and unsatisfying ending. Bloomberg explains an opening bid of $30 million jump-started what appeared to be a fierce bidding war, rising all the way to $70 millionâ€”until the auctioneer suddenly corrected himself, noting the top bid was $17 million, not $70 million. A video of the auction shows the bizarre incident unfolding. Whether it had been an accident or, as Jalopnik puts it, a joke meant to hype the sale and boost bidding, potential buyers were miffed, and no one ever topped the $17 million bid. MSNBC notes that because $17 million was below the seller's minimum price, the sale was nixed. A massive f---up, one observer notes, per Bloomberg.

Solution: Give people a financial incentive to roll up their sleeves for a shot. Immunology, meet economics, writes Mankiw. One of the first principles of economicsâ€”perhaps the most importantâ€”is that people respond to incentives. This proposal is textbook economics, he writes, delving into the particulars of positive externalities and such. It would be a huge expense, somewhere around $300 billion, but that is actually a bargain when compared to previous and proposed relief packages, Litan asserts. Mankiw adds that Congress can worry about lowering the government debt once the pandemic subsides. He ends with a suggestion to apply the principle elsewhere: Perhaps after seeing how a vaccine subsidy can end one crisis, Congress will pay for it by adopting a carbon tax to avert another.

There was a 14% rise in the number of aggravated assaults in the cities, a new analysis by the Council on Criminal Justice show. But overall, US crime is holding at the relatively low levels it's been at for years, the New York Times reports. Crimes including residential burglaries and drug offenses fell dramatically this summer. Minneapolis, Milwaukee, New York City, and Philadelphia aren't doing well reducing homicides, while rates in Baltimore, Boston, and Columbus are steady or declining. On Monday, the FBI said preliminary figures point to a 15% rise in homicides for 2020, which would be a record increase. Analysts advance several theories for the jump in homicides, per Vox. The protests could have caused police officers to be pulled off their usual duties, or greater distrust of police could be at work. The jump in gun sales could share the blame. Social displacement caused by the pandemic might have an effect. But because 2020 is not like any other year, the usual logic may not apply, said a Yale expert.

Per the Wisconsin State Journal, the college's Campus Planning Committee unanimously voted last week to recommend to Chancellor Rebecca Blank that Chamberlin Rock be removed from Observatory Hill, where it's been perched since being excavated from the side of the hill in 1925. The school's Black Student Union had started calling over the summer for the boulder to be yanked off the hill, noting it reminded students of color of the school's history of racism. The rock itself, which was named after onetime university chief and geologist Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, had been referred to in the past as a n-----head, a common term in the late 1800s and early 1900s for a large, dark rock or a variety of other objects, like chewing tobacco or stove polish, per the Journal. It's not clear how often the term, which more or less vanished by the '50s, was used in the Madison area: The Journal prominently used it once in a 1925 article, per university historians, who say they've had trouble finding other instances due to unorganized archives.

In fact, the little guy still has his teeth, limbs, nose, whiskers, and eyelashes, reports the Siberian Times. The big question still unanswered: whether he's a dog or a wolf. The prevailing school of thought is that dogs split from wolves about 40,000 years ago, reports LiveScience, meaning he could be either one, or perhaps a hybrid. Further testing now underway might answer the question. What scientists do know is that the pup they named Dogor ( friend ) still has his milk teeth, making him less than 2 months old at the time of death. One good thing: Dogor doesn't appear to have been in stress when he died.

They then ditched the car and hopped on a bus bound for Sonora, Mexicoâ€”and that's when they were busted with the weapons and $3.8 million in cash after being randomly flagged for inspection at a checkpoint. Meanwhile, back in Anchorage, it took bank officials an entire day to get the vault door open when Cazarez was a no-show for work. Cazarez was charged and convicted in Mexico for money laundering and illegal possession of firearms and served out that sentence before being shipped back to the US.

Per the New York Times, the latest Morning Consult poll asked 2,200 Americans in April about these tasks, and when it came to helping kids with their homeschooling or distance learning, 45% of men with children under the age of 12 said they were the ones who did the bulk of it, not their spouse. But that's not how women are seeing it: Only 3% of those polled said their spouse is the main homeschooler, with 80% of women saying they've been assuming most of the teaching duties. The poll also found that while both men and women are having to do more domestic chores overall while in quarantine, the crisis seems to be cementing traditional gender roles, with women still taking on the lion's share of responsibilities around the house. The Guardian notes the domestic load for women just got heavier, while the Atlantic has called the stuck-at-home phenomenon a disaster for feminism.

Harrison says a man approached a crowd on foot and began firing in what he called a very tragic, very cowardly shooting. Speaking at the scene afterward, Harrison said the shooting appeared extremely targeted, but he didn't provide a possible motive, the AP reports. One man who was shot collapsed behind a Baptist church nearby and was pronounced dead at the scene. The commissioner said there were two cookouts taking place on opposite sides of the street Sunday, and that shell casings were found in two different locations, indicating that there may have been a second gunman, or someone firing back at the first shooter, who fled on foot. Harrison and acting mayor Jack Young urged members of the public to help investigators with any information as to who took part or a motive. Someone knows something, Young said.

That would change quickly, of course, and a new study demonstrates how events like this international conference helped COVID-19 establish its foothold. In a massive genomic research project, scientists estimate that this single get-together was responsible for 20,000 coronavirus cases in four counties of Massachusetts by early May, reports the Boston Globe. Of particular note: They traced this version of the virus to a large outbreak among Boston's homeless community just a few weeks later, per WBUR, though how it made its way from the conference to the city's homeless shelters isn't clear. Weâ€™re not trying to point fingers, says Bronwyn MacInnis of Broad, Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, one of the authors of the study. The circumstances of this eventâ€”the fact that it happened so early in the epidemic and the timing of where we were with COVID in the public consciousnessâ€”meant it had a disproportionate effect. The 20,000 figure is an extrapolation, but scientists not affiliated with the study think it's legit. For the study, which hasn't been peer reviewed, researchers analyzed the genetic sequences of the virus in 772 patients and found that 289 of them could be traced to the Biogen conference. That is by far the largest single source, with the rest coming from more than 80 different versions that were introduced to the state. Some versions fizzle out, others light fires, says MacInnis, and more studies like these might help scientists figure out how and why.","From a Single Get-Together, 20K COVID Cases"

In this case, it comes 50 years after the monthlong Battle of Hue in 1968. After his captain was wounded in the fighting, then-Gunnery Sgt. Canley took command of his company to fend off multiple enemy attacks over a week, reports ABC News. On several occasions, despite his own wounds, he rushed across the fire-swept terrain to carry wounded Marines to safety, per a release. That included twice climbing a wall unprotected so he could move wounded fighters to safety, reports Stars and Stripes, describing shrapnel injuries. Canley is also said to have been responsible for heavy Viet Cong casualties, per ABC.

I really donâ€™t agree with them, he says of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but Iâ€™d still support them, yes, because compared to Donald Trump thatâ€™s easy. The candidate, entirely self-funded, has already burned through $200 million in his late entry to the race, and the Times notes that he's on a path to equal former President Obama's entire 2012 spending by March. You know how much money a billion dollars is? he says. Itâ€™s a lot of money to me. Itâ€™s a lot of money to anybody. Bloomberg, for the record, is reportedly worth about $57 billion.

Another Auburn alum was also diagnosed; the women started a Facebook page to look for other alums dealing with the same cancerâ€”and 36 people have gotten in touch so far, McCrary tells CBS. According to the page, most of those affected attended Auburn between 1983 and 2001. Last month, WLTZ reported that at least 31 people who attended or worked at the university from 1980 to the early 1990s have been diagnosed with ocular melanoma. Earlier this month, Healthline put the number diagnosed in the area at 33. Similarly, a number of people in the Huntersville, North Carolina, area have also been diagnosed with ocular melanoma, also known as uveal melanoma. CBS puts the number at 18, while WFAE reports that 23 people who lived, worked, or spent significant time in Mecklenburg County since 2000 have been diagnosed with the disease.

The results show that many Americans, particularly young adults, lack a basic understanding of the Nazi genocide during World War II. Though 96% of respondents said the Holocaust took place, 31% believe a maximum of 2 million Jews were killed, well under the actual figure of about 6 million, reports the New York Times. The percentage increased to 41% among millennials, defined as those aged 18 to 34. Some 41% of Americans and 66% of millennials had no idea about Auschwitz, the death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland where an estimated 1.1 million were killed, per WFTS. The executive vice president of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which seeks restitution for Holocaust victims and their heirs and commissioned the February survey of 1,350 respondents, says the gaps in understanding are troubling given that some 400,000 Holocaust survivors are still living. Imagine when there are no longer survivors here to tell their stories, he says, stressing the importance of Holocaust education. He's backed by survey respondents, 93% of whom said it was important to teach about the Holocaust in schools.

The hunt is, as always, under fire for its lack of apparent connection to legitimate scientific research and for killing whales rather than taking a non-lethal survey (Japan says its aim is to show the whale population is healthy). This year's 12-week expedition, in which whales were killed using harpoons fitted with explosives, has also been particularly criticized for the number of pregnant females that were killed. Of the 128 mature females killed, 95.3% were pregnant, reports the Guardian. The expedition was detailed in a report to the International Whaling Commission. The killing of 122 pregnant whales is a shocking statistic and sad indictment on the cruelty of Japanâ€™s whale hunt, a Humane Society International program manager says in a statement. Whether Japanâ€™s whale hunts are legal is a bit murky, notes the New York Times. Under a 1946 international ruling, countries may kill whales for scientific research. In 2014, an international court found Japan's whale hunt was for commercial purposes, not scientific, and temporarily banned the country from whaling in the Antarctic Ocean; a year later Japan began a new program that reduced the number of whales it kills by two-thirds and that, per Japan, has a scientific purpose. But experts contend the new program is still for profit; the whale meat is eventually sold as food. Theyâ€™ve sought to exploit this loophole, one legal expert tells the NYT. Japan says that aside from research purposes, whale hunting is an important part of its culture, notes the BBC.

Analysts warn that a slowdown in China could seriously affect global growth, especially since many economists suspect that the real figure is around half what Beijing reports.

They're still not happy this week, and they're making arrests to express their continued displeasure. The Guardian and Egypt Today report that two people have been arrested by the country's Interior Ministry, though it's not photographer Andreas Hvid and the friend who apparently scaled the pyramid, stripped naked, and embraced while overlooking Cairo, videotaping and taking photos of themselves as they went. Instead, a camel driver who works in the area near the pyramids has reportedly been detained, accused of helping Hvid and the young woman on Nov. 29 get up the pyramid; he's said to have charged them about $225. Also believed to be in custody, per Ahram: a woman who's said to have known the couple online and helped bring together the two with the camel driver. Hvid has since spoken with a Danish newspaper and says this was his third try at climbing the pyramidâ€”and first successful attempt, in just 25 minutesâ€”though he stresses that he and the woman didn't engage in any sexual activity while they were up there. He says they simply posed for a risque photo. Hvid also says he wasn't trying to insult or offend anyone, and he adds that because of the outrage, he won't be returning to Egypt anytime soon for fear of being arrested himself.

Two years prior, he was penniless, unemployed, and bracing himself for foreclosure. What happened in the interim is the subject of an Esquire piece by David Kushner, who explores the Australian's wild ride. It started with that near foreclosure. Kushner writes that Moore steeled himself for the final shoe to drop on July 15, 2010, the day his mortgage payment was set to auto-debit from his empty savings account with St. George bank. But the payment went through, with his account showing it was overdrawn. And then the next payment went through. His subsequent experimentsâ€”requesting transfers of $5,000 and $50,000 to his mortgage companyâ€”succeeded, with the bank either not noticing or not caring about the mounting overdraft. So he decided to live large. The then-24-year-old moved to Surfers Paradise along Australia's Gold Coast, bought an Alfa Romeo, and started spending his days at the beach and his nights at bars and strip clubs. While he couldn't withdraw cash from St. Georgeâ€”the only way to facilitate the overdraft was by transferâ€”he realized he could request transfers to PayPal and then move the money to another Australian bank. And the method worked, until Dec. 12, 2012, when he was apprehended and charged with dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception in connection with the overdraft, which tallied $1,671,201 with interest. He was sentenced to 4.5 years. But Moore didn't sit idly in prison. He set out to free himself by proving his actions didn't amount to deception. And he actually succeeded.

The order from Tiny Jewel Box, DC's premier destination for fine jewelry and watches, was signed off on by Millan Hupp, whom Pruitt referred to as a longtime friend in congressional testimony last year, per CNN. That's significant because Pruitt has attempted to distance himself from pricey EPA purchases, blaming it on career staff, but in this case it was a close aide rather than a career staffer who signed off on the purchase. The dozen pens, at $130 a pop, were engraved with Pruitt's signature and an EPA seal; a spokesperson says they are similar to purchases Pruitt's predecessors made for the purpose of serving as gifts to the Administrator's foreign counterparts and dignitaries upon his meeting with them. Indeed, a $2,952 purchase was made from the same shop during the Obama administration. The EPA is also, of course, under fire for a $43,000 phone booth.

A man in Syracuse received a bill for $4,595.12 after doctors performed a sigmoidoscopy, meaning they inserted an 8-inch scope into his rectum, reports the Syracuse Post-Standard. They did so against his will, on the orders of a judge and police, who were sure that 42-year-old Torrence Jackson had hidden drugs in his anus. The kicker? Physicians at St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center found no drugs. But they billed Jackson anyway for the procedure, which required putting him under an anesthetic. The newspaper pieced together the October 2017 incident based on medical and police records and interviews with more than a dozen people, including doctors and Jackson. The story includes criticism that police overreached in getting a court order to make the hospital conduct the search. Itâ€™s crazy. Itâ€™s over the top, by far, says criminal attorney Hermann Walz, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Jackson, who has a long criminal record and a history of resisting arrest, was pulled over for a traffic violation. Police say he became belligerent in custody, taunted police by saying he had drugs in his rectum (Jackson denies this), and refused to consent to a search. He also refused to drink any liquid that would speed up a bowel movement. That's when they asked for the sigmoidoscopy, which doctors initially refused because Jackson would not give his consent and an X-ray that had been performed showed nothing in the rectum. The hospital gave in when a judge signed off on the search warrant.

Jail records do not indicate whether the father has a lawyer who could be reached for comment.

The officers had been at an earlier rally in support of Black and Indigenous people providing security and protecting [the protesters'] First Amendment right to peaceful assembly, per a Chicago Police Department statement cited by CNN. The Chicago Tribune lays out the timeline, which started around 4:20pm with the rally. Demonstrators then started marching down Columbus Drive around 7pm when word got out that the Columbus statue in Grant Park was being protected by police. That's when members of the group rushed the short stone wall that encircled the statue, hurling frozen bottles, rocks, and other objects at the officers, the department's statement notes. CBS Chicago video shows fireworks being set off around the statue, while another clip from a Tribune reporter shows a man yelling, This is not the way! as protesters clash with police. Officers were pushed back, and one protester scaled the statue, which ABC7 notes was covered in plastic, and threw a rope around it. The crowd tried for about 30 minutes to pull the statue down, to no avail, but they did manage to cover it and the wall with graffiti. Police reinforcements arrived by 7:40pm, using tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd. Some of the 18 injured officers were treated by paramedics at the scene, while others were taken by paramedics to local hospitals; a Chicago Fire Department rep says five civilians were also hospitalized. Meanwhile, about a dozen people were arrested, with pending charges to include battery to a police officer and mob action, per the CPD statement.",Protest in Chicago Park Leaves 18 Cops Injured

Gina Marie Marks, 45, operated Readings by Natalie out of a home in Bethesda, Md., but the $100 tarot card readings she offered were just the beginning, the Washington Post reports. From there, she convinced clients to withdraw large amounts of cash and hide it in pillowcases or under mattresses so energy from their bodies could travel to the bills; then the clients were to give Marks the cashâ€”the more they gave, the more committed they were to Marks' spirit guides â€”so she could put it on an altar at her church in order to break evil curses placed on the client or carry out spells for the client. If clients emptied their bank accounts, they were told to make pricey purchases like designer handbags, using a credit card, for the same ritual. Though clients were told the money and items would be returned, they never were. Marks was convicted of defrauding five clients for amounts ranging from $2,655 to $153,400 each; she had pleaded guilty to felony theft in February, NBC Washington reports. Victims say if they balked at the amount of money they were told to hand over, Marks would accuse them of not taking the work seriously or warn them that their doubts would anger the spirit guides. She convinced them of her authenticity by using phone spoofingâ€”she would tell a client someone (say, an ex over whom the client was heartbroken) would call on a certain day and time, but warn the client not to answer; phone spoofing allowed Marks to place the call from her own number, but make it appear as if it was coming from the ex's number. Marks, whose lawyer said she is prepared to pay almost $129,500 of the total amount due in restitution, insisted to the judge her work was legitimate and that she cared about her clients. To that, the judge said he felt he was being scammed.",Psychic' Convinced 5 Clients to Hand Over $341K

The Des Moines Register reports on the recent passing of 5-year-old Garrett Matthias, who died July 6 after a nearly yearlong battle with a rare, aggressive cancer. Over the past few months, Garrett and his parents had some frank discussions about death, and at one point Garrett noted, Why are funerals so sad? I'm going to have bouncy houses at mine. An idea was born, and together the family started planning Garrett's send-off when his cancer was declared terminal in June. That included writing Garrett's obituary, which he helped his parents with by answering queries you might see on an about you questionnaire. The now-viral obituary details his favorite superheroesâ€”including, of course, Thorâ€”things he loves (playing with his sister, thrash metal) and hates ( dirty stupid cancer ), and what he would have wanted to be as an adult: a pro boxer. It also lays out what he intended to do once he died. I am going to be a gorilla and throw poo at Daddy! he notes, adding he wanted to be made into a tree so I can live in it when I'm a gorilla. His parents say they're going to do just that, once [they] figure out how the hell to get his ashes made into a tree. Garrett's final signoff on the obituary: See ya later, suckas!

That's due to a final analysis of their late-stage vaccine trials, which showed that the vaccine proved 95% effective, even in older age groups. This surpasses preliminary results reported last week showing a 90% efficacy rate. Efficacy was consistent across age, race, and ethnicity demographics, the companies noted. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%. The New York Times notes that latter fact is especially important, as older adults are more apt to suffer worse symptoms of COVID-19 and don't always respond well to certain vaccines. The latest results emerged after 170 volunteers came down with COVID-19. Of that group of infected patients, 162 of them had gotten placebo shots; just eight of those infected had received the vaccine candidate. An independent group keeping tabs on possible side effects also has good news. To date, the data monitoring committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns, the companies said in their statement, noting that fatigue emerged in a small percentage of cases.

Republican incumbent David Yancey held a 10-vote lead after Election Day for Virginia's 94th House District. But a recount Tuesday gave challenger Simonds a one-vote win and Democrats a 50-50 tie in the Virginia House. The recount ended 17 years of Republican control in the Virginia House, the Washington Post notes. But on Wednesday, Republicans took the recount result to court over a ballot that had been discarded by election officials during the recount, the Virginian-Pilot reports. The problem: Bubbles for both Yancey and Simonds had been filled in. Judges on Wednesday ruled the ballot should be counted as a vote for Yancey. Simonds' bubble had a strike through it, and all other votes on the ballot were for Republicans. Yancey and Simonds are now tied at 11,608 votes each, and Republicans hold a 50-49 majority in the Virginia House. The next representative of the 94th House District will now be chosen by lot, as per state law.

Convicted in 2012 of setting fires that spread to federal land near the family's ranch in southeastern Oregon, the father was sentenced to three months and the son to one year by a judge who decided the five-year mandatory minimum was too harsh, reports the Oregonian.

In what researchers are calling an extraordinary case, four organ-recipients from a 53-year-old stroke victim all developed breast cancer, LiveScience reports. A new report says the donor died in 2007, had no other red-flag health issues, and came up negative on multiple cancer tests. But after 16 months, a female lung recipient developed breast cancer that DNA linked to the donor. Doctors warned the others they might be at risk and they took cancer tests that turned up negative. But by 2011, a recipient of the donor's liver was diagnosed with breast cancer and died three years later. In 2013, a kidney recipient also developed breast cancer cells from the donation and died after only two months. A fourth recipient, who developed cancer in his transplanted kidney in 2011, remains cancer-free after having the kidney removed and undergoing chemotherapy. Developing cancer via organ donation is a very, very uncommon event, says a New York doctorâ€”like somewhere between 1 in 10,000 and 5 in 10,000, per the reportâ€”because all donors are rigorously tested. CT scans might spot more hidden cancers, but that would create too many false positives that leave healthy organs unused, per the Independent. In this case, researchers say the donor may have had cancer-cell groups that were too small for imaging or screen tests to detect.",Healthy' Organ Donor Kills 3 in 'Extraordinary' Case

It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103, his son Michael Douglas wrote on Instagram, per the Hollywood Reporter. The actor known for his dimples and fierce gaze acted in a wide range of films, from The Bad and the Beautiful to Champion to Lust for Life and Paths of Glory. The three-time Oscar nominee (and recipient of an honorary Oscar in 1996) is also cherished in Hollywood for breaking the 1950s blacklist by crediting Dalton Trumbo for his screenplay on Spartacus, in which Douglas starred. He was also a political activist, family man, and charity benefactor, notes Variety. His intense ambition was rooted in family. Born to Russian Jewish immigrants in Amsterdam, NY, Douglas was the poor son of a ragman. He rose up by putting himself through university, served in the Navy, and returned to civilian life to act on Broadway and, soon after, in Hollywood. A rebel with strong opinionsâ€”and a reputation for being difficultâ€”he started his own film company and made his own films. He was married twice and had four sons, who all went into the movie business. A 1996 stroke nearly led him to suicide, but he fought on. And on the big screen, he's always a giant: To me, acting is creating an illusion, showing tremendous discipline, not losing yourself in the character that you're portraying, he once wrote, per the New York Times.

These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves. The discovery was a leap forward: It pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 Nobel Prizeâ€”but not for Bell Burnell. Instead, the prize went to Antony Hewish, Bell Burnell's PhD supervisor, the Guardian reports. Bell Burnell's exclusion from the Nobel Prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy. But, since then, Bell Burnell has won plenty of other accolades. I feel I've done very well out of not getting a Nobel Prize, she tells the Guardian.

That was back in the early 2000s when Adrian Lamo made a name for himself hacking into corporate websitesâ€”not for financial gain but to expose weaknesses. He even ended up with a felony conviction after infiltrating the New York Times' computers. But Lamo truly became famous as the person who turned in Chelsea Manning to government authorities. He went from being hailed as a hero among hackers to vilified as a snitch. His life went into a downward spiral, culminating in his death last year at 37 in, of all places, a senior living facility in Kansas. The cause of death remains officially undetermined, adding only more mystery (and conspiracy theories) to Lamo's story. Temple-Raston unpacks all this and takes an educated guess at what happened. By 2018, Lamo had been using drugs heavily. He was in the senior living facility because the parents of a friend got him in there; as it turns out, anyone with a low income qualified, and Lamo had no job. Hours before he died, Lamo left a voice note to himself speaking of agonizing pain because he had twisted his leg. Temple-Raston's theory: After spending some time on the computer and having dinner he took something to help him relax and maybe ease some of that muscle pain, she writes. He went into the bedroom, lay down on the clothes, curled up, and just stopped breathing. It wasn't natural, suicide, homicide or completely undeterminedâ€”it was an accident.

A slew of studies has since threatened to upend Wunderlick's work, with research suggesting that number was always too high, the Wall Street Journal notes. But according to a new study in the eLife journal, it may not have been Wunderlich's number-crunching that was faultyâ€”the human body may simply have changed over time, leading the current average down to 97.5 degrees. Stanford scientists analyzed more than 675,000 temperature readings from nearly 190,000 subjects over a span of 157 years, using everything from pension records of Civil War veterans and a CDC survey administered in the 1970s to more recent Stanford research. What the researchers found is that, in general, temperatures of the Civil War vets were higher on average than those examined from the '70s; the latter, meanwhile, were higher than the more recent Stanford-collected temps. These figures suggest that as our environment changed over the decades, our bodies adapted. Julie Parsonnet, the lead author of the study, tells Scientific American they're not sure what the direct causes could be, but warmer clothes, better control of indoor temperatures, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and a drop in infectious diseases could all have played a part in making us colder.

He has demonstrated serious and persistent abuses of power that, in our view, satisfy the constitutional standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors.' The authors lay out specifics, stating that Trump conditioned protection of the military security of the United States and of an ally (Ukraine) on actions for his personal political benefit and subordinated the integrity of our national electoral process to his own personal political interest. They also accuse him of withholding evidence and directing agencies not to cooperate with Congress.

The Sun reports Harry presented little Prince Louis with a first-edition 1926 Winnie-the-Pooh book, a gift that's said to have set him back about $10,600 at rare-book purveyor Peter Harrington. The idea behind Harry's gift is apparently a tribute of sorts to Princess Diana. She loved all the old classics, and Harry had the brilliant idea of starting a little library of first editions for Louis, Charlotte, and George to enjoy as they get older, a friend says, referencing Prince William and Kate Middleton's other two children. The friend notes the AA Milne classic wasn't Harry's first choiceâ€”the 33-year-old originally had his eye on Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, which would have cost him nearly $32,000, on sale (he figured Pooh would be a better first read).

The killer is believed to have killed at least five gay men and possibly up to 14 in 1974 and 1975, SF Weekly reports. Police say the killer would approach men in bars, sketch them, and leave with them. The victims were stabbed multiple times; one was nearly decapitated. The bodies were left in the open in locations including beaches and golf courses. Inspector Dan Cunningham, who recently took charge of San Francisco's cold case unit, tells CNN they have a suspect and are now connecting the dots. Cunningham says he is trying to track down a European diplomat believed to be one of three people who were assaulted by the Doodler and survived. The victims provided information that helped police create a sketch. But fearing their sexuality would be exposed, they refused to testify when a man matching the suspect's description was arrested outside a bar with a butcher knife and a book of sketches, meaning the man, who is apparently still the main Doodler suspect, was never charged. Cunningham says he plans to work with the crime lab to see if a usable DNA sample can be taken from 43-year-old crime scene evidence. If the suspect is still alive, he would now be in his early 60s.

A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the outbreak says that 116 confirmed coronavirus casesâ€”80% of the people at campâ€”can be traced to that one boy. He was isolated after showing symptoms. The state then tested nearly everyone in camp, finding at least one confirmed case in every dorm room and yurt.

Trump's legal team still has not decided whether he will indeed sit for an interview, and if he refuses to do so, that could result in a subpoena. And if they subpoena him, there will be litigation. So no timeline on that, Giuliani said. The obstruction allegations against Trump are just one part of Mueller's wide-ranging inquiry, meaning his work would continue even if the September deal happens, notes the Times.

At his January arraignment, Davisâ€”who was sent to prison for more than a year in 2012 for a home invasion and also has been convicted of window peepingâ€”was then charged with another sexual assault at his workplace, though his lawyer says he started working there after the assault report. In both cases, Davis contends police led the victims to believe he was their attacker, and that even after the DNA and other evidence started to surface in February showing he wasn't in the car case, he was still incarcerated for months. He also says his face and name were plastered everywhere after his arrest, and he lost his two jobs and was evicted from his home after he got out of jail, per WOOD. He said he told cops during his initial questioning: You guys are gonna be sued after this if you don't fix this. Charges in both cases were dropped, and WOOD notes Davis has since secured a new job and place to live. (Cops hope DNA will lead them to the Zodiac Killer.)",DNA Cleared Him.

Michael Brandon Samra, 41, was pronounced dead at 7:33pm following a three-drug lethal injection at Holman prison, authorities said. Samra and a friend, Mark Duke, were convicted of capital murder in the deaths of Duke's father, the father's girlfriend, and the woman's two daughters, ages six and seven, in 1997. The two adults were shot and the children had their throats slit. Evidence showed that Duke planned the killings because he was angry his father wouldn't let him use his pickup, the AP reports. Prosecutors said Samra slit the throat of 7-year-old Chelsea Hunt as she begged for mercy. Though Duke and Samra were both originally convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, Duke's sentence was overturned because he was 16 at the time, and the Supreme Court later banned executing inmates younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. Samra was 19 at the time. His attorneys asked the US Supreme Court Tuesday to consider expanding their ban to include 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, but they declined to review the case.

Pai had originally sued the group in 2016 for $150 million in compensatory and punitive damages, according to court documents. The composer said he'd made roughly $100,000 to $200,000 annually in royalties over 20 years, the Hollywood Reporter noted at the time, but that fell short of industry standard for his work. The payments amounted to 1% of box office, he argued, and in 2014 the group cut his payments in half. This case involves an old story, Pai says in his complaint.

Nonetheless, a North Carolina judge has ordered his wife's lover to pay him $8.8 million. The decision revolves around an obscure law on the books in six states called alienation of affection, reports WSOC. In this case, the 48-year-old King claims he was in a happy marriage with 33-year-old Danielle, whom he wed in 2010, until she began an affair with a man she met on a business trip, reports WRAL and Inside Edition. I've compared it to like a nuclear bomb going on around my surroundings, says King, who first got wind of the affair thanks to phone records. That led to a confrontation between King and Francisco Huizar that was recorded, followed by King learning that he could actually sue his romantic rival over all this. My marriage was murdered, says King. Last week, a Durham County judge agreed, ordering Huizar to pay $2.2 million in compensatory damages and $6.6 million in punitive damages. The result is unusual, with most of the 200 alienation of affection claims filed in North Carolina each year settled out of court. But this was a very classic case that just happened to have all of the factors, King's attorney tells WRAL. Still, some argue there should be no alienation of affection law at all as it's based on the outdated view that a married woman is her husband's property.

The theft took place after a fire at a nearby power distributor knocked out the museum's electricity, rendering the alarm system useless.

The agency's overall budget, which already hovers around $20 billion, would therefore need another $4 billion to $6 billion pumped into it each year until 2024, though this estimateâ€”and Bridenstine warns it's only an estimate, as space travel is an unpredictable industryâ€”has come in lower than some expected. Per SpaceNews.com, there'd been initial speculation the price tag could run closer to $8 billion per year for five years. So far, just a small down payment, as Bridenstine calls it, of $1.6 billion has been formally requested. One challenge in getting the rest of the funds will be convincing members of Congress it's a project worth fundingâ€”a bit of a climb considering that the rocket and spacecraft that will be used in this mission are already way behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.

There's only been one other time in the last decade when the flu vaccine did a worse job. Most illnesses this winter have been caused by a nasty kind of flu called Type A H3N2. The vaccine was only 25% effective against that type. This kind of virus tends to cause more suffering and has been responsible for the worst recent flu seasons.

Dey, whose name was found on SS clothing in Stutthofâ€™s archives in 2016, is charged as an accessory to murder in 5,230 deathsâ€”5,000 attributed to hostile conditions, 200 to gassing, and 30 to a fatal shotâ€”between 1944 and 1945, reports the BBC.

Wealth transfer is what's needed, the founder of Black Entertainment Television told CNBC, putting a price tag of $14 trillion on the reparations. Now is the time to go big, Johnson said. He characterized the money as a repayment after more than 200 years of wealth being directed away from black Americans, dating to slavery. Labor taken with no compensation is a wealth transfer, he said. Denial of access to education, which is a primary driver of accumulation of income and wealth, is a wealth transfer. The payments would demonstrate that white people understand that damages are owed, Johnson said, calling his proposal the affirmative action program of all time. To eliminate the inequality that began with slavery, Johnson said, We need to focus on wealth creation and wealth generation. That divide has been growing.

The remains were exhumed and reburied by 1947, but those victims are now being remembered and discussed following a trio of excavations of the sites, reports Gizmodo. Archaeologists uncovered more than 400 artifacts and relied on historical records to piece together what happened at each site. The bulk of the finds come from the first site, a forest near Warstein, where archaeologists discovered a prayer book, a Polish dictionary, shoes, beads, buttons, and kitchen tools. The 60 women, 10 men, and a child were told they were being moved to a different labor camp and asked to temporarily deposit their belongings along the road. Then they were shot. Bullets were found scattered around the forest, suggesting some made a last-ditch effort to escape. Near Suttrop, another 57 laborers were forced to dig trenches before they were ordered inside them and shot. Per Smithsonian, fewer artifacts here suggest the perpetrators were better-prepared to cover traces of their actions. At the third site, a field near Eversberg, Nazis used grenades to create a giant pit that would become a mass grave for 80 people, including a child; they left behind a harmonica, comb stand, and Soviet coins, per LiveScience and Deutsche Welle.

The less great news: He didn't name which ones during his interview on Good Morning America. Reuters reports Redfield explained that we've seen a number of counties that have been tested for COVID-19 but have not experienced really any of it. There are a number of statesâ€”19, 20 statesâ€”that really have had limited impact from it. So I think we will see some states that are, the governors feel that they're ready, we're poised to assist them with that reopening. But a second wave of closures is certainly possible, he added: I think we have to assume this is like other respiratory viruses and there will be a seasonality to it ... and we're going to have another battle with it upfront and aggressively next winter. As for President Trump's Tuesday announcement that the US would stop funding the World Health Organization, Redfield expressed that the CDC still maintains the productive public health relationship it has long enjoyed with the WHO. When asked by George Stephanopoulos whether the WHO mishandled the pandemic, Redfield offered this, per the Hill: I'd like to do the post-mortem on this outbreak once we get through it together.","19, 20 States' Could Be Ready to Reopen May 1"

Kendrick Johnson's parents have had two of the three autopsies done, as they continue to insist the 17-year-old's death was no accident, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The Georgia sophomore was found upside down in the mat in his high school's gym; state and local investigators believe he got stuck inside while reaching for a pair of sneakers. The state medical examiner's office found that he died of positional asphyxia, meaning that he suffocated due to the position he was trapped in. The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office classified his death as accidental, and Kenneth and Jackie Johnson have been fighting that finding ever since; they have had their son's body exhumed twice, per the Valdosta Daily Times. The two autopsies done at their request found the teen died of non-accidental blunt force trauma between his neck and abdomen. The Johnsons believe their son was killed by two sons of a local FBI agent, though video evidence showed they were not near the Lowndes High School gym at the time Johnson was last seen alive. A federal investigation was opened into the teen's death and ultimately found no evidence of foul play. Because of that, the Journal-Constitution says the impact of the latest autopsy will likely be minimal. But WALB reports that in addition to the latest autopsy, the Johnsons submitted an affidavit to the local sheriff's office stating that they were told this year someone killed their son by hitting him in the chest with a 45-pound dumbbell and that surveillance footage was edited to remove more than an hour of video.

Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco also found that at the 5-year mark, 84% reported they either felt mostly positive about the experience or they felt nothing.

As the Trump administration tries to unseat Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the fate of the executivesâ€”five of them US citizensâ€”lies in the balance, per the AP. As does that of the US company they worked for, Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil giant PDVSA, and a prize in the power struggle between Maduro and a rival the US recognizes as Venezuela's rightful leader, Juan Guaido. The families of the Citgo 6 complain the men are being held in inhumane conditions, sharing overcrowded cells built for 22 people with nearly four times that number of inmates. They say the crowded conditions require the men to sometimes sleep on the floor and go without access to fresh air for weeks. The families' saga began the weekend before Thanksgiving 2017, when they got a call from the head of PDVSA, asking that they travel to Caracas for a last-minute meeting. The group, including acting President Jose Angel Pereira, flew out on a corporate jet. A group of armed and masked security agents rushed into a conference room and arrested all six. Hours later, Maduro's AG appeared on state TV announcing charges of embezzlement. Then Maduro himself accused them of treason, though they haven't been charged with that crime. A preliminary hearing has been postponed 12 times for little apparent reason, leaving the families to question whether their loved ones are being held as pawns in a high-stakes political negotiation.

He bought a few things without setting off alarms, Wired reports, so in late 2017 and early 2018, he stepped it up. After running the credit through bitcoin and Coinbase, Kvashuk, 26, cleared at least $2.8 million over seven months, prosecutors said. It was enough to cover a $160,000 Tesla and a $1.6 million waterfront home. Convicted in January of wire fraud, money laundering, filing a false tax return, and other charges, Kvashuk now has been sentenced to nine years in prison.

Andrew Cuomo announced the results of the tests Thursday, in which 3,000 people at grocery stores and other shopping sites in 19 counties were checked for antibodies, CNBC reports. The tests showed 13.9% overall had them, which would translate to possibly 2.7 million people in the state. The highest infection rate was in New York City, at more than 21%. Cuomo had said the FDA-approved test would give officials the first true snapshot of how widespread the disease is. Having the antibodies doesn't mean a person has immunity; the World Health Organization said last week that the tests don't indicate whether a person is now safe from COVID-19. If New York's results are indicative of infection rates, it would mean the number of cases is far higher than officials had thought; 250,000 cases in the state have been confirmed. But Cuomo said it would also mean that the fatality rate is as low as about 0.5%, per the New York Times. The sample wasn't completely random, Cuomo conceded, which makes drawing firm conclusions difficult. People out shopping could be exposed to the virus more than people at home, but then, they evidently were healthy enough to be out shopping. What does it mean?

Justice is seeking damages from Gwendolyn Vercher, 51, who was sentenced in July to three years' probation for first-degree animal neglect. According to court documents, Vercher denied Justice adequate food and shelter for months, abandoning him to starve and freeze.

A Brooklyn woman felt a cold coming on ahead of her vacation and went to the doctor to make sure it wasn't strep. She had a routine throat swab, gave a blood sample, and left with a prescription for antibiotics. The resulting bill: $28,395.50. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota covered $25,865.24, and the doctor's office waived patient Alexa Kasdan's portion of the remainder. Still, Kasdan is complaining about the system that produced such a bill, and NPR digs in for possible explanations. For one thing, the tests ordered were elaborate and, in the eyes of an outside doctor, unnecessary. In my 20 years of being a doctor, I've never ordered any of these tests, she says. Also, the tests were sent to a lab outside of Kasdan's insurance network. And Finally, the lab in question, Manhattan Gastroenterology, appears to be affiliated with Kasdan's physician, Dr. Roya Fathollahi, because they share phone numbers and addresses. Fathollahi declined to comment, though her office told Kasdan that nothing was out of the ordinary about the tests or the bill.

The owner of a Japanese sushi chain made history Saturday by dishing out the highest-ever sum for a single fish at the new year's auction of a Tokyo fish market, CNBC reports. I bought a good tuna, Kiyoshi Kimura told the Japan Times after buying the 613-pound fish at the new Toyosu market, but... I think I did too much. I expected it would be between 30 million and 50 million yen, or 60 million yen at the highest, but it ended up five times more. Higher than originally thought, indeed: Paying roughly $5,000 a pound when the highest rate is usually $40 a pound is a bit of a markup, notes the AP. But the Atlantic reported in 2014 that it's great publicity to win the first tuna auction of the year. It is considered an honor to buy the first bluefin of the new years, and bidding wars reflect this fight for status, food blogger Andrew David Thaler told the magazine. ... As many auction-goers know, landing a high, early win is a way of marking your territory and letting your competitors know that you have the bankroll to push them out of a bidding war. Kimura has paid record prices before, when auctions were held at the now-closed Tsukiji fish market. But all the hoopla disguises the fact that bluefin is facing extinction.

A personal detail that may come as a surprise: Hogg is dyslexic and didn't learn to read until the fourth grade. His younger sister, Lauren, chalks up his speaking style to that early dyslexia. He gets absorbed in his words because he's been doubted so much, she says. He needs to overcompensate when he's arguing.

Undergoing what's known as awake brain surgery â€”in which the patient is kept alert and engaged in an activity during the procedure so doctors can monitor and calibrate their actionsâ€”Donna set to work preparing 90 Ascoli-style olives in under an hour. Neurosurgeon Roberto Trignani, who led the medical team for this case, has completed about five dozen of these awake surgeries, with patients doing everything from singing and playing instruments to watching cartoons. But the BBC notes the preparation of the olive dish is somewhat more complex, as it involves cramming seasoned meat into the olives, then coating them in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs before they're fried. What activity is chosen for each patient depends on what part of the brain is being operated on, as well as what the patient is familiar with. A sick person enters the hospital and finds himself in an unfamiliar environment, Trignani told Italian media, per ABC.

A storm hobbled her yacht, however, forcing a dramatic rescue in the Indian Ocean. At the time, Sunderland wrote that she never expected to see her vessel, Wild Eyes, again. Now, much to her surprise, she has finally done so. A plane spotted the boat, overturned and covered in barnacles, drifting off the coast of Australia, reports the BBC. My heart skipped a beat, the 25-year-old tells Australia's ABC News. It brought back many memoriesâ€”good and not so goodâ€”but it was neat to see it after so long. Australian authorities took photos, but they have no plans to actually retrieve the boat. That would change only if it is deemed a hazard to other vessels. Abby, for her part, wonders if some of the video she shot and stored in waterproof cases might have survived. She now lives in Alabama, her father tells the Australian outlet. She is a mother of three, soon to be four, happily married, says Laurence Sunderland. At the time of their daughter's adventure, he and his wife, Marianne, took a lot of grief for allowing her to go.

I might expect to see a 25-pound ovarian tumor, but a 132-pound tumor is very rare, says Dr. Vaagn Andikyan of Danbury Hospital, where the operation took place on Feb. 14. His patient, a 38-year-old woman, had experienced sudden weight gain of about 10 pounds per week for two months and went to her OB/GYN, per Live Science. A CT scan then revealed a noncancerous tumor growing on her left ovary. Because the mucinous mass grew to sit on her digestive tract, the 350-pound patient was extremely malnourished ahead of surgery and used a wheelchair because of the tumor's weight, Andikyan says. The tumor itself was gigantic, pushing up against blood vessels and putting the woman at risk of potentially fatal blood clots, doctors tell CNN. She was so hopeless, because she had seen several other doctors, and they were unable to help her, Andikyan adds. The woman is now recovering well and back to work as a teacher after doctors removed the mass, her left ovary, left fallopian tube, and excess skin stretched by the tumor (see a pre-surgery image here). Reconstructive surgery was also required as the abdominal wall had been pushed out by the tumor.

And yet that tiny population enabled drugmaker Vertex to make roughly $1.3 billion in sales off the product. How does that math work out? The annual price of the drug is $272,000 a year, a figure perhaps even more eye-popping when the drug's effectiveness is factored in. In a piece that focuses on how New York state is using a new law to push back against that sticker price, the New York Times explains the drug's positioning: 2012 saw the approval of the first drug that tries to counteract the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. But Kalydeco can only be used by a small subset of patients with a specific genetic mutation. When Orkambi followed in 2015, it was hailed for its ability to treat nearly 1 of every 2 patientsâ€”except it's not as effective. Medicaid must cover almost all FDA-approved drugs; per federal law, state programs get a minimum 23% rebate. The Times explains New York last year passed a law that enables it to ask pharma companies for a price break if the state's drug budget passes a certain threshold. New York in April determined Orkambi was one of 30 drugs whose cost effectiveness was out of whack. It sought price cuts, specifically one of about 70% off the list price for Orkambi. State officials say Vertex was the only drugmaker who didn't play ball. A rep for Vertex backs that up, saying the company plans to stick with the 23% discount it is required to pay.

The lawsuit alleged one of the duck boat's axle's had busted, leading to the accident. The jury found Ride the Ducks of Seattle about one-third at fault for the crash, while placing two-thirds of the blame for the accident on Ride the Ducks International, which built the vehicle, per the AP and MyNorthwest.com. The plaintiffs' complaint had alleged that Ride the Ducks of Seattle had dismissed a 2013 service announcement to take care of a known axle flaw; all other Ride the Ducks operations outside of Seattle had reportedly made the fix.

The Orange County Sheriff's office said it began investigating Spikes, who had created a Twitter account to post Disney backstage content for movie and theme park aficionados, when he posted a picture on Twitter of a retired animatronic character wearing its clothes two months after the reported theft of the robot's garments. The stolen items belonged to Buzzy, a character from the now-closed Wonders of Life attraction at Epcot, investigators said. The entire animatronic was later stolen, according to Friday's arrest warrant. Detective said a search warrant for Spikes' cellphone turned up photos of stolen Disney wigs, skirts, and jackets.

Tonight's court ruling will change lives, the ACLU tweeted on a federal judge's preliminary injunction to order all children affected by a zero tolerance immigration policy back with their parents. Per the Los Angeles Times, kids younger than 5 must be reunited with parents within 14 days; older children must be reunited within 30 days. In a ruling brought about by a chaotic circumstance of the government's own making, US District Judge Dana Sabraw noted the unfortunate reality of cars, money, and other personal items being tracked better than the more than 2,000 children who've so far been taken from their parents, per Politico. Certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process. Under Sabraw's mandate, parents also can't be detained or deported without their kids, unless it's shown a parent is unfit or otherwise poses a danger, and prompt phone contact between parents and kids must be allowed, per NBC News. The injunction was a response to a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two women separated from their children, including a Congolese woman who made headlines. Sabraw's ruling comes on the heels of an executive order from President Trump that was supposed to remedy the separations, but which stayed silent on the issue of reuniting families that have already been separated or will be separated in the future, wrote Sabraw, a George W.

Further examination revealed it was the first direct evidence that Neanderthals could make string, and the oldest known direct evidence for string-making overall, researchers say. The find implies our evolutionary cousins had some understanding of numbers and the trees that furnished the raw material, they say. It's the latest discovery to show Neanderthals were smarter than modern-day people often assume. Bruce Hardy, of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and colleagues report the discovery in a paper released Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports. The string hints at the possibility of other abilities, like making bags, mats, nets, and fabric, they said. It came from an archaeological site in the Rhone River valley of southeastern France, and it's about 40,000 to 50,000 years old, the AP reports. Researchers don't know how Neanderthals used the string or even whether it had been originally attached to the stone cutting tool. It was made of fiber from the inner bark of trees. Neanderthals twisted three bundles of fibers together counterclockwise, and then twisted these bundles together clockwise to make the string.

In a Feb. 4 message sent to all NPS employees, park safety chief Elston Stephenson says the uranium specimens, previously kept in the cellar at park HQ, were moved to the museum collections building in 2000, where they remained until June 2018.
