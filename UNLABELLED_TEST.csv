TEST_1_1,"(Dec 10, 2016 3:08 PM) Samsung is preparing to release a software update that will turn every Galaxy Note 7â€”excellent fire starter, less good smartphoneâ€”into a very expensive paperweight, Gizmodo reports. Samsung issued a full recall of its once-heralded new smartphone two months ago because they wouldn't stop exploding, but some people are still using them. Samsung will roll out the new update, which will keep Note 7s from charging or working, starting Dec. 19. But US carriers are rebelling, according to the Verge. Verizon says it won't pass the update along to its Note 7 users because it could keep them from contacting family and emergency services in the heart of the holiday travel season. (Never mind that the phones have been banned on flights due to the whole exploding thing.) And AT&T and Sprint say they won't be releasing the doomsday update until the holidays are over in January."
TEST_1_2,"(Mar 16, 2017 8:15 PM CDT) State troopers have charged two Pennsylvania women with disorderly conduct for a hair-pulling fight that erupted over a newly shoveled parking spot on a snowy street, the AP reports. Troopers in Schuylkill County say a 23-year-old woman claimed she shoveled the spot only to have her 43-year-old neighbor's husband park his pickup in it. It happened in Ashland borough on Tuesday night. The region took the brunt of that day's winter storm. Police say the women argued about the parking space before pushing and punching one another, and then pulling each other's hair. Both have been charged with disorderly conduct."
TEST_1_3,"(May 3, 2017 6:59 AM CDT) Tucker Carlson's star isn't only rising on television. The Fox News host and longtime conservative commentator has a two-book deal with Threshold Editions, the publisher tells the AP. No details were immediately available about the books by Carlson, who has become one of Fox's biggest names with the departures of Megyn Kelly and Bill O'Reilly. Numerous publishers had expressed interest, and his literary agency, Javelin, says the deal is worth eight figures. Threshold, a conservative imprint of Simon & Schuster, has also released books by President Trump and former Vice President Dick Cheney, among others. I have long admired the Threshold list and am proud to be published alongside so many of my favorite authors, Carlson said in a statement. Carlson, who turns 48 later this month, is host of Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight, founder of the conservative online publication the Daily Caller and author of Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News, which came out in 2003. On Tuesday, Nielsen reported that in Fox's first full week with a new prime-time lineup that features Carlson in the hour formerly held by the fired O'Reilly, ratings increased slightly over the previous week."
TEST_1_4,"(May 15, 2017 2:58 PM CDT) A pizza delivery man in Delaware got an order from an unusual address: a stalled Amtrak train from New York on its way to Washington. Passenger Mitchell Katz posted a video of delivery man Jim Leary walking up to the train Sunday evening as it sat on the tracks. People on board were getting restless after being left without access to food or water during the long delay and eventually some passengers came up with the idea of ordering a pizza, Katz said. Leary, a driver for Dom's Pizza in Newport, Delaware, tells the AP he cut through a backyard, navigated a steep embankment, and jumped over a water-filled ditch all while balancing the two pies in order to make the delivery. The 46-year-old Leary was rewarded with a cheering crowd of passengers and a total of $32 in tips for his effort. Leary's 17-year pizza delivery career has brought him to addresses in 32 counties across 18 states, but he said the broken down train is one of the strangest. I do whatever it takes, he said. Amtrak said on Twitter that a mechanical issue was to blame for the delay. Eventually, another train was brought in to take the passengers to Washington, Katz said. Amtrak's website shows the passengers arrived more than three hours late."
TEST_1_5,"(Dec 6, 2016 9:06 AM) To be circumcised should be an informed, personal choice, or so thinks the Danish Medical Association, which on Friday issued its recommendation that no boy under age 18 in the country be circumcised. Going that route then leaves the door open for the male to make a decision of his own when he has come of age, says Lise Moller, the head of the associationâ€™s ethics board. That's not to say the doctors' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says Moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in Denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of Jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in Denmark's national patient registry, reports the Local. Doctors who fail to do so will be fined, reports the Post. The CDC reports that in 2010, an estimated 58% of male newborns were circumcised in the US. (This mom went into hiding and then to jail in an attempt to avoid circumcising her son.)"
TEST_1_6,"(Jan 30, 2017 9:02 AM) When the British warship Lord Clive was blasted by Spanish cannon fire just off the coast of Uruguay in 1763, about 270 crew members went down with the ship. Now a treasure hunter from Argentina hopes it's also still home to more than $1 billion in gold coins, reports the London Timesâ€”half of which he could be entitled to. Ruben Collado also thinks the ship is stocked with the likes of rum, opium, and silk, and he plans to prove it by raising the vessel next month. Collado himself found the ship by accident in 2004, just 380 yards off the coast and 16 feet underwater. (Spaniards had pinned it under rocks to keep it submerged). The shallow depth is what gave up its location: Collado's vessel struck its mast in the River Plate estuary, reported AFP. He then waited more than a decade for Uruguay's permission to salvage it. The Lord Clive went down during a military mission amid the Seven Years' War, in which British and Portugal were trying to take the city of Colonia del Sacramento. Collado thinks the 64-gun ship, which belonged to the British East India Company, made the fatal error of anchoring too close to shore, within range of Spanish cannons. The Feb. 10 operation is expected to cost about $5 million for the team of 80 divers, technicians, and other support staff to raise the ship. The hope is that it can shed more light on British naval expeditions in South America. The rescue of the ship would have an impact on the city no less important than when UNESCO declared it, justly, a World Heritage Site, says Colonia's director of tourism. (One famous wreck has been particularly dangerous for divers.)"
TEST_1_7,"(Jul 18, 2017 6:29 PM CDT) President Trump had a previously unreported and undisclosed meeting with Vladimir Putin during the G-20 summit, White House officials confirmed Tuesday. The only other person present for the conversation was the Russian president's translator, the Hill reports. According to the Washington Post, Trump had his first face-to-face meeting with Putin during the summit July 7; later that same day he attended a couples-only dinner with other world leaders. Halfway through the meal, Trump left his seat and took one next to Putin. Their hour-long conversation was held just outside listening distance of other diners. Ian Bremmer of the think tank Eurasia Group says other leaders have said they were bemused, nonplussed, befuddled by the private conversation. The meeting was not disclosed to reporters traveling with Trump, and Reuters reports the White House isn't giving details about what was discussed during Trump's second meeting with Putin. National Security Council spokesperson Michael Anton tells CNN he can't say what was discussed as no staff were present. He says the dinner was attended by only leaders, spouses, and translators. Other White House officials say the only version of the meeting they have is Trump's own. Bremmer says Trump breached national security protocol by not having his own translator present for the conversation with Putin. Trump reportedly only brought a Japanese translator to the dinner to facilitate conversation with Japanese President Shinzo Abe."
TEST_1_8,"(Dec 6, 2017 10:55 AM) It's been more than six years since Casey Anthony was acquitted, but as WKMG reports, the legal saga surrounding daughter Caylee Anthony's death hasn't ended for her. Anthony this week filed a motion in a bid to get former Orange County, Fla., meter reader Roy Kronk's lawsuit against her dismissed. He was the one who found Caylee's remains in August 2008, and in December 2011 he sued Anthony for defamation, alleging she instructed her lawyers to smear his name publicly and suggest he tampered with the placement of the body. Her lawyers insinuated Kronk may have done so to snag a reward, with attorney Jose Baez calling him a morally bankrupt individual who actually took Caylee's body and hid her in his opening statement. Kronk testified that he never got closer than 30 feet to the remains. His suit also highlights a 2009 CBS interview with another member of Anthony's team, Linda Kenney Baden, who when asked about Kronk said, You know, it's easy to snatch a kid away. In her motion, Anthony says Kronk supplied no proof that Anthony told her defense team to push Kronk's name, and she says the statements they did make weren't defamatory but, rather, part of an effort to highlight how investigators zoomed in on her at the expense of considering other suspects. The suit had previously been moved to bankruptcy court, and Anthony is asking that it be discharged from her bankruptcy case. The Orlando Sentinel in 2016 noted that some salacious new allegations were made as part of Kronk's case."
TEST_1_9,"(Jan 16, 2018 4:13 PM) Losses by industrial and technology companies pulled stocks lower Tuesday, erasing an early gain that sent the Dow Jones industrial average past 26,000 points for the first time. In the end, the Dow fell 10 points, less than 0.1%, to 25,792, per the AP. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 9 points, or 0.4%, to 2,776, and the Nasdaq composite lost 37 points, or 0.5%, to 7,223. Also of note, General Electric slumped 3% after reporting a $6.2 billion write-down. Media company Viacom dropped 7% following reports that it's not in talks to merge with CBS, and Energizer surged 14.5% after saying it will acquire the battery and lighting assets of Spectrum."
TEST_1_10,"(Dec 1, 2016 7:07 AM) It's not really a surprise that Prince was worth a whole lot of money when he died in April, but now there's a number on it. The singer's estate is estimated to be worth $200 million, per a court filing, which is about half of what David Bowie's will estimated his own estate was worth when he passed away in January, the AP notes. The news agency figured out this estimate by taking the monthly fee charged by the company overseeing Prince's estate, per a memo, then extrapolating that based on the company's fee schedule, which is based on the worth of an estate; two estate lawyers not tied to the case agree it's a fair estimate. There's no known will in Prince's case, so after taxes (which will probably slash the estate's worth in half or so), his sister and five half-siblings aim to split the estate equally."
TEST_1_11,"(May 2, 2017 7:50 PM CDT) Kaden, Hunter, and Jackson Howard were born newsworthyâ€”the Long Island triplets were conceived without fertility drugs, and Hunter and Jackson are identical while Kaden is fraternal. But not long into their young lives, the happy news took a turn. Their heads became noticeably misshapen. Kaden had a pointy forehead and Jackson and Hunter sported protrusions in the back, reports Today. All three were diagnosed with craniosynostosis, a rare birth defect in which a newborn's skull fuses together early, which can impede brain growth. The triplets, born in October 2016, underwent a set of surgeries at just two months of age in January and are all thriving back at home, apparently not even minding their helmets, which they must wear 23 hours a day for the next six to nine months. Your skull is made up of plates, itâ€™s not a single bone, says operating surgeon David Chesler of Stony Brook Children's Hospital. If the plates fuse too early, it can detrimental to the brain, the vision, the life of the child. Itâ€™s not imminently life-threatening, but it can cause real consequences down the road. It occurs just once in every 2,000 births, but doctors put the odds of it occurring in tripletsâ€”particularly a set that isn't identical and thus not prone to the exact same malformationsâ€”at one in 500 trillion, reports CBS Local. Mom Amy calls their progress amazing and their father, Mike, says that while life with three boys and three cats is crazy, he wouldn't change it for the world. They say they'd love to have a girl, but aren't planning to try. With our luck, we would have another set of triplets, Mike says. (One mom ran a half marathon pushing her triplets in a stroller.)"
TEST_1_12,"(Apr 5, 2017 5:49 PM CDT) Fire officials found Robert Wylie banging on the door of the fire department, holding his 13-year-old son's unconscious body. But the doses of Narcan they administered couldn't save the teen. Nathan Wylie died of a suspected heroin overdose on Saturday, four days after he was taken to a Dayton, Ohio, hospital, reports the Dayton Daily News. Officials say Nathan had access to drugs because his father is an addict. Wylie had already been arrested for child endangerment after another minor who lived at Wylie's home sent a relative a photo of white powder, a razor blade, and a crack pipe in the home in Feb. 2016, police say. He was later arrested for drug possession after he was found with heroin and crack cocaine during a traffic stop in December, with Nathan in the backseat, police say, per CBS News. It isn't clear why Nathan remained at the residence. A rep for Montgomery County Children Services tells the Daily News only that there was a case open with this family and that Nathan's sibling was removed from the home following Nathan's death. After Nathan was taken to the hospitalâ€”a witness told officials Wylie was on drugs and the boy got into his stuff, per WXIXâ€”Wylie was again arrested on suspicion of child endangerment. The 40-year-old was released in that case on Thursday. However, he remains in Montgomery County Jail in relation to the December case. Wylie's live-in girlfriend, Tina Davisâ€”who was previously charged in the February caseâ€”faces new charges of drunk driving and drug possession after an arrest on Sunday.

TEST_1_13,"(Mar 22, 2017 9:18 AM CDT) A fall off an LA pier led to the unraveling of a mystery that's been haunting Kayannette Gabrielle's family for over a decade. People tells the story of the California woman, originally from Colorado, who disappeared from the lives of her grown kids in April 2006. At first Brett, Colette, and Jared Hanlon speculated their mom had traveled to Australia, but she never came backâ€”not even for the funeral of her own mother. Even the private investigator they hired came up empty. We had no luck, Brett saysâ€”until Feb. 28 of this year, when he got a phone call from the LA County Sheriff's Department. Are you sitting down? was the text Brett sent next to Colette, per the Denver Post, revealing the news that Gabrielle, who'd apparently been suffering from severe memory loss, was alive and homeless in Santa Barbara, where she'd been living for several years as Mary Roberts. Gabrielle's fall led to her being treated at a hospital, then placed in a shelter, where a few weeks ago she suddenly remembered her name. Cops ran that name, found her driver's license, and contacted her kids, whom she started to remember as their names were mentioned and their pictures shown. Although Gabrielle hadn't exhibited signs of memory loss before she vanished, she told Colette and others she'd been attacked in an Oregon park and her memory deteriorated after that. The family had an emotional reunion in early March in Santa Barbara, and now Gabrielle's kids are trying to help her recover lost memories. The more we talk to her, the more things pop into her head, Colette tells the Post. (The family of a man with dementia may have dumped him in England.)"
TEST_1_14,"(Apr 4, 2017 5:43 PM CDT) Michelle Dinning called police Tuesday morning when she couldn't find her 9-year-old son, Josh, last seen in his bedroom the night before. For nearly four hours, a search party roamed the area looking for the UK boy; the police force put dozens of officers, search dogs, and even a helicopter to the task, the Times reports. And then they decided to check the family home a second time ... and there was Josh, under his bed. Or, more specifically, in his bed; he had crawled through a gap in the bed frame, the Northern Echo reports. Why? He didn't want to go to school. Officers found him after deciding to actually lift up all the beds. I just couldn't bring myself to be angry with him, the relief that he was alive and well was just too much, says his mom. Josh was discovered just before a press conference on his disappearance was set to take place. The search is estimated to have cost the police force thousands of dollars, but the official statement on the matter makes no mention of that. We can confirm that missing Josh Dinning was found at around 12:40pm hiding in a hidden drawer compartment under his bed, the statement says, adding that the police force will be reviewing its search procedures and looking into why he wasn't found in the initial search of the home. The Chronicle has a picture of the compartment where Josh hid."
TEST_1_15,"(Apr 24, 2017 1:48 PM CDT) It was a story made famous for younger generations via the 1994 Ralph Fiennes movie Quiz Show, and now one of the central characters in the 1950s scandal is gone. The New York Times reports that Albert Freedman, once a producer on NBC's popular Twenty-One program, died on April 11 in Greenbrae, Calif., at the age of 95, a victim of heart failure, his stepson Todd Dworman confirmed. Freedman joined the show's staff in 1956 and immediately set out to find a contestant who could take down the reigning champion, Herbert Stempel, who kept on winning, causing ratings to flag. Freedman found Charles Van Doren, a Columbia University instructor, and the Hollywood Reporter notes that Van Doren not only sent Stempel home in December 1956, but kept going until March 1957, ultimately taking home nearly $130,000. Where Freedman came in: He gave Van Doren answers to questions, as detailed by Van Doren in a 2008 New Yorker article (Freedman said in a 2000 interview with the Archive of American Television he only provided areas Van Doren should concentrate on.) A probe by a congressional subcommittee uncovered cheating on other game shows as well. Twenty-One was canceled, Freedman was arrested and indicted for perjury for lying to a grand jury about his role in the scandal (the perjury charges were later dropped), and he lost his job and eventually moved to London, where he started writing for Penthouse's Euro version. He also earned a doctorate in the early '80s and went on to lecture human sexuality and women's rights. Freedman is survived by his second wife, Nancy; a daughter and a son; and three stepchildren."

TEST_1_17,"(Nov 5, 2016 5:26 AM CDT) A former executive at a New York investment bank who admitted defrauding investors of more than $38 million was sentenced to four years in prison Friday by a judge who cited his gambling addiction as reason for leniency. I chose gambling over everything, Andrew Caspersen, 40, told US District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan. In July, he pleaded guilty to securities and wire fraud, admitting defrauding mostly family and friends of more than $38 million as he worked for PJT Partners Inc., which he also defrauded of over $8 million, the AP reports. Prosecuters said the scam involved an elaborate scheme involving made-up private equity ventures, fake mail addresses, and fictional financiers. I lost their money. I abused their friendship. I destroyed my family's name, said the son of the late Finn M.W. Caspersen, a prominent philanthropist and former chief executive of Beneficial Corp. Still, Caspersen packed the courtroom with family and friends as well as members of organizations he has joined to fight alcohol and gambling addictions. Many of them argued for leniency in letters to the judge, who credited Caspersen's very real gambling disorder as he imposed a prison term that fell well short of the 15 years called for by sentencing guidelines. A defense attorney said his client was so overtaken by the madness of his gambling illness that he hit a high of over $100 million one day and bet it all the next on whether the market would go up or down, leaving him with almost nothing."
TEST_1_18,"(Dec 9, 2016 2:32 PM) A powerful survey from the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that, of the 622 long-term prescription opioid users (at least two months of use) surveyed, virtually all were introduced to the drugs not through illicit means but via a prescription from a doctor, more than 60% got no advice from said doctor as to how or when to stop using the painkillers, and one-third ended up addicted to or physically dependent on the drugs. The Post calls the survey one of the most comprehensive polls of long-term opioid users to date. Another 187 people who said they share a household with an opioid user were also surveyed, and their responses to the question of addiction or physical dependence were different from the users' responses: More than half of them suspected the users they live with are addicted, and they were also more likely to say that the drugs have caused harm to the users' health, finances, or relationships. But, while the survey raises sharp questions about the responsibility of doctors for an epidemic of addiction and overdose that has claimed nearly 180,000 lives since 2000, as the Post puts it, it also found that most long-term opioid users say the drugs improve their lives, allowing them to walk, work, and do other things that pain would otherwise prevent. Two-thirds of those surveyed said the risk of getting addicted was worth it because of how much relief the drugs offer. The survey results were released as the CDC announced opioid deaths (from both prescription and illegal sources, such as heroin) skyrocketed again last year. A new study is also out showing that doctors discussing the risks of opioid abuse with patients could reduce misuse and abuse. The Post says about 5% of US adults have used prescription opioids for at least two months during the past two years, and around half of those people say they've taken them for two years or more.

He lays out the offer in a full-page ad in the Sunday edition of the Washington Post. During last year's presidential campaign, Flynt dangled $1 million to anyone who could turn over video or audio capturing Trump behaving in an illegal or sexually demeaning manner. That followed the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood video in which Trump bragged of sexually assaulting women."
TEST_1_20,"(Jan 15, 2018 7:10 AM) Authorities in Colorado are investigating how a 20-year-old nurse died in a bungee jump accidentâ€”when the equipment was apparently working properly. Ciara Romero died after a fall Jan. 4 at the 70-foot Get Air attraction at the Silo Trampoline Park in Grand Junction, the Denver Post reports. The jump requires participants to jump off a tower connected to a rope attached to a harness. After free-falling for around 20 feet, they are supposed be caught by the device and slowly lowered to the ground. The Grand Junction Sentinel reports that in results confirmed by state investigators, the company that makes the device says it carried out tests and the device, webbing, and triple-locking carabiner were found to be intact, and functioning normally. State investigators say they will now focus on witness statements, and the Grand Junction Police Department says no criminal charges will be filed. According a a police report seen by News Channel 5, employees and other witnesses said Romero was reluctant to jump. She was hesitant, you know, pretty freaked out, one employee told police, Kind of scared, but excited to go. Video shows employees checking to make sure the harness was properly attached, the report says. The report states that an employee told investigators that it was possible Romero's hand could have slipped and opened the carabiner. The employee said this would have been very difficult, though an officer wrote that he found the carabiner to be relatively easy to open with one hand and believes it could have happened accidentally."
TEST_1_21,"(Nov 4, 2017 6:00 AM CDT) US authorities on Friday released a 10-year-old immigrant girl with cerebral palsy who had been detained by border agents after surgery because she is in the US without legal permission. The ACLU and US Rep. Joaquin Castro said that Rosa Maria Hernandez was returned Friday afternoon to her family, the AP reports. Her parents brought her into the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was a toddler, and they live in the Texas border city of Laredo. A cousin who is an American citizen took Rosa Maria from Laredo to a children's hospital in Corpus Christi on Oct. 24, where she was scheduled to have emergency gallbladder surgery. To get to Corpus Christi, about 150 miles away, she had to pass through an interior checkpoint in South Texas operated by the Border Patrol. Border Patrol agents followed Rosa Maria and the cousin to the hospital, then took the girl into custody after the surgery and transported her to a facility in San Antonio for unaccompanied immigrant minors, under the custody of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The Border Patrol has said it had no choice but to detain Rosa Maria, arguing that she was considered an unaccompanied minor under federal law, the same as a child who crosses into the United States alone without legal permission. The ACLU sued the government on Rosa Maria's behalf Tuesday, argued that the US government violated federal law on unaccompanied minors and endangered Rosa Maria's health by not sending her home. While Rosa Maria has been reunited with her family, she still faces the threat of deportation. Tan said Friday that Border Patrol agents had issued Rosa Maria a notice to appear in immigration court, but that the case had yet to move forward."
TEST_1_22,"(Jun 20, 2017 1:03 PM CDT) The government has released its report on the first-ever fatal self-driving car accident, and it shows that human involvement is required even when using the technology of the future. Last May, Joshua Brown collided with a left-turning truck on a divided highway near Williston, Fla., while his Tesla Model S sedan was in Autopilot. On Monday, the National Transportation Safety Board released 500 pages of findings about the accident, including a big one: During his trip, Brown ignored seven visual warnings to put his hands on the wheel, six of which were followed by a chime, reports Reuters. During a 37-minute stretch when he was supposed to be controlling the wheel, he did so for only 25 seconds. The report exonerated Brown on one thing: It found that he didn't seem to be watching a movie when the crash happened, as some reports had suggested. Unequivocally false, says the family lawyer, saying the movie theory should be laid to rest. At the time of the accident, Tesla released a statement saying neither the autopilot system nor Brown noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. According to the report, the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds, but the driver took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision. Less than two minutes before the accident, Brown had set the cruise control to 74 mph, nine miles per hour over the speed limit. Since the accident, Tesla has upgraded its Autopilot feature, which will now shut down if a driver fails to respond to audible warnings. For a diagram of the how the accident occurred, see Business Insider."

Air Force spokesman Capt. Mark Graff said the grounding of 55 of the Air Force's 200 F-35s followed five separate in-flight incidents since May 2. Graff said in each case, the airplane's backup oxygen system worked as designed and the pilot was able to land the plane safely. The Air Force has established an action team of engineers, maintenance specialists, and aeromedical specialists to study the five Luke incidents, he said. The cancellation is limited to F-35s at Luke. F-35 operations at five other US bases are not affected."
TEST_1_25,"(Jun 7, 2017 1:00 PM CDT) A female peacock has ruffled more than just feathers at a Los Angeles-area liquor store. Without a peep, the peahen strutted into the open door of the Royal Oaks Liquor Store in Arcadia on Monday. Store manager and college senior Rani Ghanem said he didn't even know it was there until a customer walked in and asked him about el pollo, Spanish for the chicken, the AP reports. Ghanem, a 21-year-old San Bernardino resident whose family owns the store, said he then tried to guide the sharp-clawed bird outside but that she spooked, at one point flying directly toward him and then up onto a top shelf of the store. An animal-control officer responded after Ghanem called 911, approaching the peahen with gloves and a fishing net. That's when things got a little crazy. He was trying to get it with the fishing net, and (the bird) jumped on the first wine bottle. When that happened, I was like, 'Aw, this is about to be a big mess,' Ghanem said. It just went straight diving into all the bottles. The more he kept on trying to use the net, the more it kept on flapping its wings and knocking everything over. At one point, cellphone video taken by Ghanem shows the officer catching a wine bottle in the net as the bird crashes through a shelf and a dozen bottles shatter to the ground. Unable to watch more destruction, Ghanem puts on a sweatshirt to protect himself from the bird's claws and helps the officer ensnare it. He said they took the bird outside, unharmed. In all, Ghanem said the peahen was in the store for 90 minutes and broke $500 worth of the family store's best bottles."

In a follow-up to last week's Wall Street Journal article that alleged an adult film actress was paid $130,000 in 2016 to stay mum on a consensual sexual encounter with a then-married Donald Trump in 2006 comes the In Touch article, published Wednesday. It is based on a 2011 interview with Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and describes her meeting Trump at a 2006 golf tournament and having textbook generic sex that night. Among the more salacious details: that the encounter allegedly happened four months after Melania Trump gave birth, and that Trump told Clifford she was beautiful like his daughter. Per the article, the two met up on future occasions, with the Times quoting it as saying Trump last called Clifford in late 2009 or early 2010. The In Touch article says it backed up Clifford's claims via a polygraph and corroboration from an adult-film colleague and her ex-husband. Clifford has since denied the affair, and Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, again disputed the account to the Times, calling it the recirculation of an old and debunked story. As far as recirculation goes, Slate Group editor-in-chief Jacob Weisberg also elaborated on his conversations with Clifford in August and October of 2016 (no story was published at the time) in a piece for Slate, writing, The worst Trump had done, she said, was break promises sheâ€™d never believed he would fulfill. Like the In Touch article, Weisberg says Clifford told her Trump had promised her a slot on The Apprentice. The story has gotten the late-night treatment, too: Stephen Colbert discussed it Wednesday, quipping, Wow, maybe In Touch magazine should lead the Russia investigation."
TEST_1_27,"(Jan 4, 2017 11:11 AM) Rex Tillerson will take a $180 million retirement deal and make a complete break from ExxonMobil if confirmed as secretary of state. In a deal announced Tuesday, Exxon says the former oil executive who resigned on Dec. 31 will sell his 611,000 shares of Exxon, worth about $55.5 million, and receive the value of a little over 2 million restricted shares, now worth about $184 million, in an independently managed trust, reports Bloomberg. Tillerson would have received the 2 million shares over a decade had he reached Exxon's mandatory retirement age of 65 in March, reports the AP. In total, he'll lose about $7 million, including $4.1 million in cash bonuses and benefits he would've received over the next three years, per Politico. Tillerson also agrees not to work in the oil and gas industry for 10 years; if he breaks that condition, the money in the independent trust will be given to one or more charities involved in fighting poverty or disease in the developing world without input from Tillerson or Exxon, the company says, adding Tillerson will sever all ties with the company to comply with conflict-of-interest requirements associated with his nomination as secretary of state."
TEST_1_28,"(Dec 6, 2017 8:35 AM) She was the last survivor of a story that gripped Great Britain and the world more than 50 years ago. So says the attorney for Christine Keeler to the Guardian upon news of the 75-year-old's Monday night death. She had been living under the last name Sloane in an attempt to put more distance between herself and the Profumo affair that she was so infamously and indelibly attached to. In 1961 Keeler, then a young cabaret dancer working in London, met Tory cabinet minister and rising political star John Profumoâ€”as well as Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov. She began affairs with both men, and when the triangle came to light in 1963, it gripped Britain, played upon Cold War fears, and triggered events that led to the undoing of the Harold Macmillan government. The BBC reports Keeler caught Profumo's eye while splashing in a swimming pool at a party in Buckinghamshire; she was 19, reports the Washington Post, and he was 46 and married. Their brief affair surfaced in a convoluted way: Two other men fought over Keeler, and one of them fired shots into a home where she was hiding. Police investigated, and Keeler's connection to Profumo ultimately became publicized. The Ivanov angle led to fears of a security issue; when Profumo was questioned by Parliament, he characterized his relationship with Keeler as platonic. Profumo ended up resigning after admitting he lied. An interesting note from the BBC: Keeler later claimed she had been sleeping with Ivanov at the same time as she was having an affair with Profumo, but many commentators have since dismissed her account."
TEST_1_29,"(Dec 9, 2016 12:37 AM) Los Angeles prosecutors on Thursday sued four national retailers, accusing them of duping shoppers into believing they got bigger discounts than they actually did, the AP reports. The separate lawsuits alleging deceptive advertising were filed against JC Penney, Sears, Kohl's, and Macy's, according to the Los Angeles city attorney's office. Customers have the right to be told the truth about the prices they're payingâ€”and to know if a bargain is really a bargain, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. Feuer said the retailers falsely advertised higher regular prices for merchandise so customers believed they were getting bigger bargains. California law bars retailers from advertising a higher original price unless the product was sold at that price within three months of the ad. The lawsuits seek civil penalties up to $2,500 for each violation and injunctions to stop so-called false reference pricing to increase sales. Prosecutors said thousands of sale items were advertised at false reference prices. One of the lawsuits said JC Penney was selling a maternity bathing suit top online for $31.99 in February, down from a so-called original price of $46. The top was later marked down further but still compared to the $46 price point, even though the item was never actually sold for $46. Prosecutors said JC Penney and Kohl's previously faced class-action lawsuits alleging similar deceptive business practices and had agreed to stop. There was no immediate comment from any of the retailers."

A federal grand jury on Friday indicted Adam W. Purinton, 51, on two counts of hate crimes and a firearms charge in connection with the February attack in a bar in Olathe. Purinton allegedly shouted racial slurs when he shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, who later died, and Alok Madasani, 32, both of whom worked for the tech firm Garmin. A third man who stepped in was wounded. Local authorities charged Purington with first-degree murder and other charges, but federal prosecutors were under pressure to act at a time when President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric was being blamed for sparking violence, the New York Times reports. Local media reported Purinton thought he had shot two Iranians. Justice Department officials said they had not decided whether to seek the death penalty for Purinton or life in prison, per Reuters. Kuchibhotla's widow, Sunayana Dumala, tells the Times that although the indictment was a reminder to me that Srinivas is not here with us â€¦ the federal charges will give us national visibility to help spread the message of reducing hate crimes. Effects of the attack reverberated far beyond Kansas, with the father of one of the injured men in India warning parents there not to send their children to the US, per the Post.

TEST_1_32,"(May 7, 2017 5:41 AM CDT) Steven Holcomb was ordinary and remarkable. America's best bobsled pilot was a self-described computer geek who rubbed elbows with Hollywood stars. He was never exactly in the best shape, yet was a world-class athlete. He attempted suicide years ago, then revealed his story in hope of helping others. He nearly went blind, then won gold. His life was the epitome of a bobsled race, reports the AP, filled with twists and turns. It came to a most unexpected end Saturday in Lake Placid, NY, when he was found dead in his room at the Olympic Training Centerâ€”sending shock waves through the US Olympic community. The three-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champ was 37. The only reason why the USA is in any conversation in ... bobsled is because of Steve Holcomb, said pilot Nick Cunningham, who roomed next to Holcomb in Lake Placid. He was the face of our sport. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. No cause of death was immediately announced. However, there were no indications of foul play and USA Bobsled said it was believed Holcomb died in his sleep. An autopsy is set for Sunday. Holcomb's signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver Games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold-medal drought for the US. Holcomb also drove to bronze medals in both two- and four-man events at the 2014 Sochi Games, and was to be part of the 2018 Olympic team. Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, US Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. Holcomb was cherubic, almost always happy in public, and teammates spent a season chronicling his Holcy Dance, a less-than-rhythmic shuffle. His agent tells USA Today he recently spent a week with him. Everything was cool, he said. He told me with the world championships being in Whistler in 2019, that would be his swan song.

But the treeâ€”believed to be among the nation's oldestâ€”is not long for its spot in the church graveyard, reports the AP. Crews are due Monday at the Basking Ridge Presbyterian Church in Bernards to begin removing the 600-year-old tree. The two to three days of chopping will draw attention from residents of a bedroom community about 30 miles west of New York that has long celebrated its white oak. It's been the place to go for formal photos, a landmark for driving directions, and a remarkable piece of natural history. I know it seems funny ... to mourn a tree, but I'm really going to miss seeing it, says a resident. Arborists say the tree had stood for nearly 300 years before the church was built in 1717. It stands about 100 feet tall, has a trunk circumference of 18 feet and a branch spread of roughly 150 feet. The tree was declared dead after showing rot and weakness in the last few years, likely due to its age. Arborists determined it wouldn't be able to stand many more harsh winters or spring storms. Among notable visitors was Gen. George Washington, who town officials say picnicked at the tree with the Marquis de Lafayette. It has been an integral part of the town, that's for sure, says a member of the church's council. It has always been there, even before there was a town. Experts say fewer trees are replicating the old oak's 600-year lifespan due to several factorsâ€”including droughts, wildfires, and invasive insects. But the tree's legacy will go on, notes NJ.com: Another white oak, cultivated from the old tree's acorns, was recently planted on church property. It now stands about 20 feet tall."

Sumiko Iwamuro has spent six decades making dumplings in the restaurant she and her brother inherited from their family, but when her husband died in her 70s she decided to pursue her passion for music and took a year-long course on DJing at a local music school, reports Mashable. Now 82, she continues to work in her restaurant by day but now also hits the turntables at DecaBarZ, a nightclub in the heart of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, as a monthly fixture, reports Reuters. In Japan, more than one in four people are 65 and older, but Iwamuroâ€”who goes by the name DJ Sumirock or, as news outlets like to call her, DJ Dumpling, reports DJ Magâ€”plays to a crowd 60 years her junior. She is shattering stereotypes, as China Global Television Network puts it. She's got this energy that is beyond her age, one 25-year-old clubber says. Iwamuro describes her music as techno, which she thinks would be boring on its own, mixed with jazz (her father was a jazz drummer), French chanson, and classical music.

TEST_1_35,"(May 17, 2017 2:15 PM CDT) For the first time, women in their early 30s are having more babies than younger moms in the US, the AP reports. Health experts say the shift is due to more women waiting longer to have children and the ongoing drop in the teen birth rate. For more than three decades, women in their late 20s had the highest birth rates, but that changed last year, according to preliminary data released Wednesday by the CDC. The birth rate for women ages 30 to 34 was about 103 per 100,000; the rate for women ages 25 to 29 was 102 per 100,000. It's becoming more common to see older parents with kids in elementary or high school, says Bill Albert of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Meanwhile, more teens are growing up with fewer of their peers getting pregnant, he says. We always talk about peer pressure as a negative, but it can be a force for good, Albert says. Among the report's findings: the overall birth rate was down slightly in 2016, to 62 births per 100,000 women ages 15 to 44; the average age when women have their first child is about 28; and the teen birth rate continued to drop last year."

Search-and-rescue missions continued, and Sevier County mayor Larry Waters said they had found three people who had been trapped since the fires started spreading wildly in high winds on Monday night. The mayor said the three were OK. That is some good, positive news for a change, he said. The mayor said authorities are still working to identify the dead and did not release any details about how they were killed. State law enforcement set up a hotline for people to report missing friends and family. Officials have not said how many people they believe are missing. Three brothers being treated at a Nashville hospital said they had not heard from their parents since they were separated while fleeing the fiery scene during their vacation. Gatlinburg police chief Randall Brackins said they have searched about 30% or less of the city so far. More than 14,000 people were evacuated from Gatlinburg on Monday night, and many of them are still nervously awaiting word of when they can get back in the city to see if they still have homes. Storms moved through the area Wednesday. Officials in the Gatlinburg welcomed the rain but were worried about mudslides, rock slides, and high winds knocking trees onto power lines, perhaps creating new fires similar to the deadly ones that sparked Monday night."

Police arrested Joao Batista Groppo, 64, after it was discovered he had kept his wife, Sebastiana, locked in a cellar for 8 years. Actually, the period of time is in disputeâ€”Groppo initially told police it had been 16 years, but he later said it was 8, which was confirmed by his son. The latter may face charges as well, because he knew of the imprisonment and did not report it. Police described the locked basement where Sebastiana was detained as filthy, dark. Groppo and his wife had been married 40 years, a relationship that disintegrated, according to Groppo, as she descended into mental illness. After an anonymous tip alerted police to Groppo's abuse, he said that locking her up was the only way he could think of to prevent her from wandering off and getting lost. Police also arrested Groppo's girlfriend as an accomplice. Sebastiana was examined in a hospital and released to her son. She appears to be in good physical condition, but to be on the safe side we asked the son to make sure she gets a full checkup and continued psychiatric help, police said."

A 911 caller in the home begged for help, describing the shooting as a domestic situation. The shooter had set the house on fire; the first officers on scene went into the house because they felt they had to act quickly, Crump said. Authorities pulled two victims from the home in a cul-de-sac, then a tactical team stormed in 45 minutes later when the gunfire stopped and shot the gunman, he said. Crews extinguished after it flared up for a second time, fire Capt. Reda Riddle-Bigler said, and officials found the other victims when the flames were out.

At an official briefing last night, the defense ministry said that its radar spotted a second aircraft in the vicinity and that it was probably a Ukraine fighter jet, which could have shot down the plane. The air force chief also suggested that a Ukraine missile system could have hit the plane from the ground, and he said satellite imagery suggested that Ukraine had been moving such systems into the area. He offered no proof, but as Katie Stallard at Sky News writes, Russia doesn't need to prove its caseâ€”all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim.

The Kati Roll Companyâ€”whose owner claims it was the first restaurant of its kind in the US when it opened in New York City in 2002, per the New York Timesâ€”sued Kati Rolls & Platters of New Brunswick, NJ, for trademark infringement, claiming the eatery's name was too similar to its own and confusing customers, reports NJ.com. But the nameâ€”referring to the traditional Indian wrap of meat, veggies, and flatbreadâ€”wasn't the only issue, says Kati Roll Company's owner. Payal Saha also accused Kati Rolls & Platters of stealing the eatery's decor and color scheme, per Patch.com. We found that not only had they borrowed elements of our decor ... (but) they positioned themselves as the official The Kati Roll Company, on Facebook, Saha's husband says. That is when we got a little more serious about it.

The Democrats have problems, but you can remain in that party without compromising basic intellectual or cultural values. Â But as Colin Powell implied Sunday, the GOPÂ has become the home only of its furiously angry base, Â an anti-intellectual movement celebrating a Sarah Palin vision of drab provincialism.

If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30% in taxes. He also said Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires, asserting they should not get tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98% of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up, he added. Now, you can call this class warfare all you want.

Doctors report in the journal Pediatric Neurology that the jerkiness and gravitational forces of the ride appear to be the culprit, and that the tear resulted in a blood clot that traveled to the boy's brain, causing a stroke. The boy began vomiting the next day, then developed a droop on the left side of his face on the flight home and soon couldn't walk, reports Eureka Alerts. The doctors say that while several cases of stroke resulting from roller-coaster rides have been documented in adults, this is the youngest known caseâ€”in fact, they've identified only two other pediatric cases in medical literature, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. Researchers note that children under 10 possess weak neck muscles and relatively large heads, a hypermobility that makes them more vulnerable to such tears, albeit rarely. Six months after this event, which doctors treated with low-dose aspirin, the boy still has weakness on his left side but is able to move his arm, grip objects, talk normally, perform above average in school, and even take karate lessons, which is part of his therapy, reports CBS News.

The heart of the ironically-named Highlands lies in a crescent-shaped depression that used to be a marsh, making it flood prone. So officials want to lift every building and fill in the land beneath with landfillâ€”a process that would send residents to temporary camps for about a month. The Army Corps is considering the project, which would cost an estimated $200 million, the Asbury Park Press reports. Critics say it's unclear why Highlands should get that kind of money over other coastal areas. It's a very expensive option, admits one official studying it. But the head of Highlands' Environmental Commission thinks a combination of federal, state, and private funding can make it happen. He's been backing the idea for years, well before Hurricane Sandy. At the time, it seemed as though we would be using a 1-ton hammer to drive in a nail, he says. Now it doesn't seem so out of proportion."

It could pose problems for shipping routes, CNN reports, particularly as Antarctic winter darkness makes it harder for researchers to keep tabs on it. NASA has been tracking the iceberg for five months, io9 reports. It has been surprising how there have been periods of almost no motion, interspersed with rapid flow, the researcher says.

Dravon Ames and his fiancee, Iesha Harper, say they didn't see their 4-year-old daughter steal a doll from a Family Dollar store on May 29. But after driving to a babysitter's apartment, they say an officer banged on their window and angrily threatened to kill them. Our hands are up, we're just trying not to get shot, trying to stay calm, says Ames. He had a gun drawn. One 12-minute cellphone video begins when Ames is being handcuffed on the ground and then against a cop car. The officer kicks Ames' feet apart and reprimands him several times. Another officer lowers his gun when Harper, who was five months pregnant, emerges from the vehicle with two childrenâ€”and tries to grab the younger child until a bystander takes both children. Ames gave up her kids to a complete stranger because I didn't trust the police to have her, she says. Now the couple has filed a $10 million claim, which usually precedes a lawsuit, and Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego has apologized: It was completely inappropriate and clearly unprofessional, she wrote on Facebook of the arrest.

Some historians considered Mike Hastings, the 14th earl of Loudoun, to be the true heir, descended as he was from the House of York. The AFP reports that the claim stems from documents uncovered by one historian that indicate that King Edward IV, ruler for most of 1461 to 1483, may have been illegitimate. If true, it would mean that Edward's younger brother, Georgeâ€”from whom Hastings is directly descendedâ€”should actually have assumed the throne, and Hastings would have eventually inherited the crown. Instead, Hastings moved to Australia in 1960 and became a forklift driver. He died at age 71, having never shown much interest in making a bid for the throne.

Concerns over jurisdiction stayed the SECâ€™s hand for almost 4 years, Bloomberg reports, while the alleged Ponzi scheme grew from $3.8 billion to $8.5 billion.

But the key word in that sentence is might, notes Philip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune. It's still not chump change, but all Apple actually gave Cook last year was a $900,017 salary and a $14,700 contribution to his 401(K). The hundreds of millions more come from restricted stock units he was given upon promotion. Half of those shares don't vest until 2016, and the other half don't until 2021, so if Cook flames out at Apple, his 2011 payday could look pretty modest indeed. But the SEC requires companies to report share grants as compensation in the year they're given, so lots of reporters are referring to $378 million as Cook's total compensation. But if Cook really makes that much, you could argue that he was worth it, Elmer-DeWitt writes."

A new study out of Australia finds that women are more likely to find a man desirable if he's already had one or two partners, the country's ABC News reports. There appears to be a significant desirability advantage for men who have been previously selected as a romantic partner, say the authorsâ€”amusingly, their study, published in Human Nature, is titled I Want What She's Having. The phenomenon is known as mate copying, and researchers already knew animals practiced it, but wanted to see if it played a role in human mate selection. A man seeking a mate can get a lot of the information he needs just by observing his potential mate, but ... females are not as superficial as males, the lead author explains. They need to assess things like whether their partner will be a good parent or whether he'll stay committed; that's likely why they look for a male who's already been road-tested by other females and is thus more likely to have these desirable traits. But don't take it too far, guys: The researchers asked 123 women to rate the desirability of men using photos that noted the number of relationships they've racked up in four years, and when you go to five, the guy becomes really undesirable. (More on the desirability front: A recent study found that the idea of men having trophy wives is largely a myth.)"

General Motors plummeted after posting a $4.2 billion quarterly loss, but like the October jobs report, the larger market appears to have already priced in the news. Obama and his team of economic advisers held a news conference, saying that another fiscal stimulus package was long overdue."

Itâ€™s an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States, says Buffett. I love those bets. Buffett says he uses railroad data as an indicator of the nationâ€™s financial health. Most railroad executives believe that freight volume has bottomed, and that the industry is poised to recover, and Burlington is seen as one of the best-run operators, the Wall Street Journal reports. Berkshire will pay $100 per share, a 31% premium on yesterdayâ€™s closing price, meaning the deal values the company at $34 billion."

The children were uninjured by the fire and their 20-foot fall on Thursday night in suburban Lakemba, Police Senior Constable Jamie Wallace said. Their 27-year-old mother was rescued by firefighters using a ladder and was taken to hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation and cuts, Fire and Rescue Superintendent Adam Dewberry said. The children were rescued before emergency services arrived and the details were sketchy. Dewberry said the baby boy was caught by people holding a bed sheet over scattered mattresses. He was not sure how the toddler was caught. A neighbor, who was not named, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that her father and a friend caught both children in a piece of cloth held over mattresses. Dewberry said the mother was in the window with hot smoke billowing over her and was about to jump when the firefighters arrived."

Show him the same amount of mercy he showed Eric and Cooper, and we all know how much that wasâ€”none, Dawn Miller, mother of Eric Cooper and grandmother to 2-year-old Cooper Chen, told the court. Chen, who said the cough medicine caused depression, paranoia, and a psychotic break, received the maximum sentence allowed in the state of Washington, reports the Seattle Times. We believe it is a reasonable sentence for the taking of two lives in the most horrific way possible, the senior deputy prosecutor says. Chen, an immigrant from Taiwan, met Cooper 12 years earlier, when he was in his late 20s and Cooper was a 17-year-old senior in high school. They had their son using Chen's sperm, a Taiwanese woman's egg, and a surrogate friend. They'd just moved to Seattle from North Carolina after Chen accepted a job at Virginia Mason Medical Center. When Chen failed to show up on his first day of work on Aug. 11, a hospital manager found him in his penthouse, naked and covered in dried blood; I did, he responded when asked who committed the murders. Despite his admission, the prosecutor decided not to seek the death penalty, reports Q13 Fox. Prosecutors argued it was not psychosis that drove Chen, but rage and fear over a pending breakup and custody battle. (Chen spent a week in the hospital for self-inflicted stab wounds.)"

John C. Beale, 64, a former deputy assistant administrator in the Office of Air and Radiation, accepted a plea agreement with the government at a court hearing. Under the deal, Beale faces 30 to 37 months in prison, and he must pay restitution of $886,000, forfeit an additional $507,000, and pay a fine of up to $60,000. According to the statement of offense that he signed, Beale started taking one day a week off from work starting in 2000, and indicated on his EPA electronic calendar he was working at the CIA's Directorate of Operations. He told an EPA manager that he had been assigned to an interagency, special advisory group. For 102 days from 2000 to June 2008, Beale took off while claiming to work for the CIA, the court document says. Beginning in June 2008, Beale was a no-show at work for about six months, telling managers and employees he was working on the research project or working for Langley, where the CIA is based. Then he took off from June 2011 to December 2012 for his claimed CIA work, even after he announced he was retiring from the EPA. In total, he took about 2 1/2 years off from work."

Vincent Legrend Walters had been living in Cancun under the name Oscar Rivera, working for a nearby resort's airport store for about 10 years. Apparently not a particularly brilliant criminal, Walters had reportedly bragged that he was a wanted fugitive from San Diego. Walters faces extradition and murder charges for the 1988 killing of a woman in a meth deal gone wrong. He allegedly kidnapped a drug dealer, the dealer's friend, and the friend's girlfriend in an attempt to get back some missing drugs; but, during the kidnapping, the girlfriend died from a chemical-laced cloth he used to gag her. Walters was also indicted by a grand jury in 1989 on charges of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, carrying firearms while drug trafficking, and possessing unregistered firearms and explosives."

The curse was supposedly cast during the 1945 World Series, when Billy Sianis, the owner of Billy Goat Tavern, is said to have shown up at the ballpark with his pet goat, Murphy. The goat wasn't allowed entry by Cubs owner PK Wrigley himself because it reeked, the Washington Post notes, and Sianis reportedly screamed in a rage outside the park: The Cubs ain't gonna win no more! The Cubs not only lost that World Series, but they haven't been back to the championships since, earning them the nickname the Lovable Losers. Past attempts to lift the curse have proven futile, the tavern's website notes. Per the Post, hot dog-eating champ Takeru Kobayashi joined four other competitive eaters at a Chicago restaurant last night to break the spell, and their alchemy involved chowing down on a cooked 40-pound goat in a chowdown one observer said transpired in about twelve minutes, adding, That was â€¦ disgusting. And if the Cubs don't make the playoffs? As the Post puts it, the goat gorging will just have been much ado about mutton.

It has gone over the edge, Lee Palmer told dispatchers. He's trying to attack usâ€”he's very hostile. He's at our door; he's charging us. The 4-year-old male cat, named Lux, had first scratched owner Teresa Barker's 7-month-old son on the forehead after the baby pulled the animal's tail. Barker's boyfriend Palmer then kicked the cat away from the baby, setting the animal off, KATU reports. As Lux charged, the couple locked themselves, the baby, and their dog in a bedroom and called police, as the cat could be heard yowling in the background. Officers showed up with a dog snare and chased the cat into the kitchen; it jumped on top of the fridge, but the cops managed to force it into a carrier. No one was injured, and no word yet on what will become of the catâ€”who, Palmer said on the 911 call, has a history of violence. Palmer says the family is debating what to do. Adds Barker, It's only funny when it's not happening to you. ... It was very frightening."

House Speaker Paul Ryan told GOP lawmakers on Tuesday night that a $1.1 trillion omnibus funding bill that will keep the government running until October next year has been agreed on, reports the Hill. Under the three-day rule, lawmakers will have time to review the 2,009-page text before a vote takes place on Thursday or Friday. The government's spending authority expires Wednesday, and lawmakers are expected to pass a stopgap spending bill that will give them until Dec. 22 to vote on the new package, the Washington Post reports. The billâ€”which includes a $650 billion package extending numerous tax creditsâ€”meets some key Republican demands, including the lifting of the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports and the suspension of some taxes linked to ObamaCare, while the Democratic wins include five-year extensions of wind and solar credits, the AP reports. An agreement to reauthorize health benefits for 9/11 first responders made it into the deal, and restrictions on Syrian refugees didn't. A lot of us feel like we didn't get things we wanted, but we got some stuff that we did want, and I think that's going to be true on both sides, says GOP Rep. John Kline, per the Post.

It's the largest criminal penalty against a car company in US history, according to USA Today. Today we can say for certain that Toyota intentionally concealed information and misled the public about the safety issues behind these recalls, Holder said, calling the company's conduct shameful. The deal will include a deferred prosecution agreement, which means the DoJ will suspend its indictment provided Toyota mends its ways, the New York Times reports. FBI investigators found internal records show that it knew the problem was bigger than it let on. A Toyota spokesman says the company has made fundamental changes since to improve its responsiveness. It's also already paid another $1.6 billion to settle various lawsuits from car owners. The settlement comes just as the FBI is turning its gaze on another automaker embroiled in a safety scandal: General Motors."

It seems the tent was shut down while Obama was inside, and visitors were allowed in only after being screened by the Secret Service. Since the tent effectively stopped operating during a time of day when business should have been booming, third-generation owner Mike Cunningham II estimates he lost about $25,000 in sales. The tent had been visited by three sitting presidents in the past, and Cunningham appreciated Obama's visit from a historical perspective. But I was in a position to make a campaign donation against my will, the Republican tells the Des Moines Register, adding, I wouldnâ€™t have voted for (Obama) before. I wonâ€™t again. Even so, he was nice enough to the president during his time in the tent, even giving him a Save Water; Drink Beer shirt. A tweet from Sen.

Thirty-two people were hurt, but none seriously, NBC Chicago reports. Fortunately nobody was on the staircase, a Fire Department spokesperson tells Reuters. Anybody on the staircase probably would have been killed. It's not yet clear what caused the crashâ€”CTA is reviewing video footageâ€”but there are bumping posts, shock absorbers fronted by big pieces of metal, at the end of the three train pockets at O'Hare, yet somehow the train jumped the bumper and kept traveling through the end of the platform. It appears as though the train would have been going faster than a train normally berthing at this station would be, says a CTA spokesperson. Normally a train pulls in at just a couple miles and hour and pulls into the station. Obviously this train did not stop so speed could be a factor here. A TSA employee who witnessed the crash confirms, The train didn't even slow down when it was coming in."

Travis Hittson, 45â€”convicted in the April 1992 killing of Conway Utterbeckâ€”was declared dead at 8:14pm after receiving an injection of barbiturate pentobarbital at the state prison in Jackson. When asked if he wanted to make a final statement, Hittson said, No, sir. I'm alright. Hittson blinked repeatedly for several minutes and then appeared to take several deep breaths before becoming still about four minutes after the warden left the execution chamber. The AP recounts the crime: Hittson's lawyers had said he was mistreated as a child and constantly craved the approval of others. That, they said, combined with alcoholism and relatively low intelligence, made it easy for his direct supervisor in the Navy, Edward Vollmer, to manipulate him into killing Utterbeck while the three were visiting Vollmer's parents' home in central Georgia. Hittson told investigators he and Vollmer went out drinking one night and Vollmer said Utterbeck planned to kill them both and that they needed to get him first. Upon returning to the house, Hittson shot Utterbeck in the head, according to court filings. They buried Utterbeck's torso in Georgia and the rest of the remains in Pensacola, Florida, where they were stationed. Hittson confessed months later and also implicated Vollmer, who reached a plea deal and is serving a life sentence."

Seven men were given life sentencesâ€”three of those received multiple life sentences, notes the APâ€”while another two teenagers were sentenced to lesser terms of at least 20 years each. The convictions stemmed from multiple incidents this year and last year. The verdict was greeted with shouts of injustice! from the defendants, adds Reuters, while one victim cried in relief and victims' rights advocates cheered the crackdown. This verdict is pure justice and the least that those people can get for the crimes they committed, said one victim's lawyer. The problemâ€”which rose to global prominence when video went viral of a naked victim at a mass rally last month for new President Abdul-Fattah al-Sisiâ€”had reached endemic levels: 250 assaults had been documented in Tahrir Square since 2011, with zero resulting in investigations until al-Sisi was forced to take action in the wake of public outcry.

TEST_1_107,"(Feb 16, 2010 9:12 AM) Federal prosecutors are investigating a Rhode Island lawyer who recruited terminally ill people so he could buy annuities in their names and cash in when they died. The lawyer, noted local philanthropist Joe Caramadre, began taking out ads in 2007 in the local Catholic dioceseâ€™s newspaper, proclaiming Terminal Illness? $2,000 in CASH, Immediately Available. The goal was to take advantage of the death benefit built into many variable annuities, which, because they are sold as investments, generally don't require the annuitant answer health-related questions when purchasing. The benefit essentially allowed Caramadre, and many similar enterprising investors around the country, to make million-dollar bets on the market, risk-free: If stocks rose while the person was alive, they profited; if they fell, a full refund of the investment was granted. Caramadre says he really did want to help the terminally ill, and gave people money whether they bought into the scheme or not. But the husband of one of his recruits tells the Wall Street Journal that Caramadre never mentioned the annuity. They took advantage of my wife, he says. â€˜I think theyâ€™re scumbags."

The Gallup poll, believed to be the largest ever aimed at calculating the LGBT population, interviewed more than 121,000 people. The findings upend some stereotypes about the community. If you spend a lot of time watching network television, you would think most LGBT people are rich white men who live in big cities, the poll report's lead author tells USA Today. These data suggest the LGBT community reflects more of the diversity in the US. In fact, LGBT identification is highest among younger, non-white, less educated people. Percentages of those considering themselves LGBT range from 3.2% of whites to 4.6% of African-Americans. Slightly more women (3.6%) than men (3.3%) generally identified themselves as LGBT. The range was far wider among people ages 18 to 29, with 8.3% of women and 4.6% of men considering themselves LGBT. The ultra-conservative American Research Council squawked that while the LGBT population may be 3.4% of America, they seem to enjoy 100% accommodation."

She was 113. Newman was 5 years old when the quake struck, shaking her home in a Healdsburg ranch about 70 miles north of San Francisco in the early morning of April 18, 1906. She remembered being downstairs and her father picking her up and running out of the house, says 85-year-old daughter Beverly Dobbs. The family remained on the ranch, where she grew up, because the house wasn't damaged, Dobbs says. She remembered my grandmother being upset because they had just milked the cow earlier and she had separated the cream and all and put it in containers that got thrown to the floor. Newman was a strong-willed womanâ€”she drove and played golf until her mid-90sâ€”who enjoyed great health throughout her life, which her daughter attributes to her joie de vivre. Newman and her late husband met at a dance and after marrying they continued to go out dancing. She was one who couldn't sit down, Dobbs says, adding that her parents would have a scotch with water every night before bed, a habit that could have helped her longevity. Newman never attended annual quake commemorations, because she preferred to sleep in, Dobbs says. Her mother's July 29 death leaves only one known earthquake survivor still living: William Del Monte, 109, was 3 months old when the earthquake hit, says an organizer of the quake's commemoration events.

Though operating at a quarter of its eventual capacity with 16 of 64 planned dishes, MeerKAT's first image, released Saturday, revealed some 1,300 unknown galaxies in a tiny patch of sky previously known to house only 70, reports AFP. Its other exceptionally beautiful images are far better (than) we could have expected, says Fernando Camilo of Square Kilometer Arrayâ€”a multi-radio telescope project involving 200 specialists and 20 countries that will eventually include 3,000 dishes, mainly in South Africa and Australia, reports Wired.

Naledi Pandor, South Africaâ€™s science minister, tells IOL that the quality of images is what scientists expected from 32 dishes, not 16, meaning MeerKAT is already the best radio telescope in the southern hemisphere, says Camilo. When the 64 dishes are in place next year, it will be the best telescope, not only in the southern hemisphere but in the world, adds Pandor.

Gallup, who once considered becoming an Episcopalian priest and worked as a lay minister in Texas before joining the family business, never lost his passion for religion. He specialized in polling Americans on their religious beliefs and once said gathering information on public opinion was itself a kind of ministry. This is a new frontier of research, the inner life, said Gallup, who founded the Princeton Religion Research Center and published several books on spirituality and religion. His research tracked the rise of evangelical Christianity in the '70s and the religious right in the '80s, the Wall Street Journal notes. His research, he said, suggested that while America is the world's most religious nation, many Americans tend to be ignorant about theology and religious texts.

That exceeds the original projection of 7.5 million, reports the Washington Post. This thing is working, said Obama. The president added that 35% of enrollees are 35 or younger, though he apparently misspoke because a White House fact sheet had a lower figure of 28%. Either way, it's off the goal of 38%. Still, one of Obama's main messages today was that Democrats should embrace ObamaCare in the midterms, notes Politico. I donâ€™t think we should apologize for it, he said. I donâ€™t think we should be defensive about it. I think there is a strong, good, right story to tell. What the other side is doing and what the other side is offering would strip away protections from those families, and from hundreds of millions of people who had health insurance before the law passed. Obama also spoke about today's deal with Russia aimed at reducing tensions in Ukraine, and the AP reports that he sounded a note of skepticism. The question now becomes, will in fact they use the influence that they've exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order?"

The deal, announced late last night, marks a turning point in the financial crisis: In addition to injecting nearly $300 billion into the nation's financial institutions, the feds now seem willing to take on selected banksâ€™ bad assets as well. Under the plan, Citigroup will absorb the first $29 billion in losses on the portfolio of bad assets, and the taxpayers will take on 90% of anything over that. No management changes are required, but Citigroup has agreed to comply with executive compensation limits and to modify distressed mortgages to curb foreclosures.

TEST_1_121,"(May 21, 2012 5:48 PM CDT) A New York auction house sold off a dinosaur skeleton for $1 million yesterday despite a restraining order from the Mongolian government, which said the find had been illegally exported, New Scientist reports. Heritage Auctions kept mum about the seller and winning bidder, and said it had legal assurances that the near-complete tyrannosaurus was obtained legally. A lawyer for Mongolia, however, said the auction house planned to hold back the sale until courts settled the dispute. Fossil smuggling is nothing new in Asia: Mongolia banned fossil exports more than 50 years ago, and China has seen its dinosaur and bird fossils fetch hefty prices abroad. In fact, a questionable dinosaur leg skeleton is awaiting sale at Christie's in London right nowâ€”probably worth $50,000 to $80,000. It is very likely to be from Mongolia, says a paleontologist who warned the auction house about the sale. But as there is no provenance, it may have been exported prior to [Mongolia's] imposition of an export ban on fossils."

The market was crowded with shoppers and goats being sold to celebrate the upcoming Muslim festival of Eid. The mayor, Abdul Malik, who was initially reported to have survived, died in the attack, said a top official. Malik, who had once been a Taliban supporter, later switched sides and formed a local militia to help fight the militants. A young girl was among the 12 killed, officials said. Twenty-five wounded peopleâ€”several in critical conditionâ€”were rushed to a hospital, police said.

Some 100 were injured in the attack that began as gunmen opened fire and hurled grenades before a vehicle packed with explosives hurtled through a barricade into the building. The blast was powerful enough to shear walls off buildings in the main business district. A huge explosion rocked our entire building, said a BBC worker in a nearby office. Glass windows shattered to pieces and the ceiling came down on the floor.

TEST_1_125,"(Jul 20, 2015 5:53 AM CDT) In 1960, astronomer Frank Drake pointed a radio telescope at two stars hoping to hear aliens. The $2,000 initiative proved unsuccessful and a recent lack of funding has meant the search for alien communication has fallen by the wayside. Now, in the biggest breakthrough for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence since, Russian billionaire Yuri Milner has announced $100 million in funding over a decade for SETI researchers to scan the 1,000 closest stars for alien life as part of a new project, Breakthrough Listen. We have a responsibility to not stop searching, Milner, the man behind the Breakthrough Prize, tells the New York Times. We should be listening. The money will go toward new receiving equipment, hiring students and astronomers, and securing time on the largest radio telescopes in West Virginia, San Jose, Calif., and Australia, reports Nature. Scientists have heard fast radio bursts in the past, in a typical 24-36 hours on a telescope per year, but now we'll have thousands of hours per year on the best instruments, a SETI scientist says. It's difficult to overstate how big this is. It's a revolution. The Breakthrough Listen team adds the money will allow scientists to see radar and even tiny lasers from stars up to four light-years away. It's quite likely that we won't find anything, Milner notes. But in 10 years' time, there will be even more advances and we can work out the best strategy for the next 10 years of the project, and then maybe the next 10 after that. The observations are expected to begin next year, reports Scientific American, and the data will be made available to the public. Milner is also planning a Breakthrough Message competition. People will be able to submit a digital message that could be broadcast into space. The winner will receive a $1 million prize. (One scientists suspects aliens are huge.)"

But the Wall Street Journal calls the payments interim compensation ; the final compensation payment hasn't been decided and could end up being resolved in court. The $50,000 payments will cost the insurer almost $12 million, the International Business Times reports.

A Malaysian official says the determination of full payment will come when we announce the issue on the tragedy MH370 is over.

Azaz, a town near Turkey, took the brunt when airstrikes killed 14 at a children's hospital and a shelter inside a school, local sources say. We have been moving scores of screaming children from the hospital, says a medic who found two children among the dead. In the north-western town of Marat Numan, Idlib province, seven others died when missiles struck a hospital backed by Doctors Without Borders. The destruction of the hospital leaves the local population of about 40,000 people without access to medical services in an active zone of conflict, Massimiliano Rebaudengo, the head of Doctors Without Borders in Syria, tells the Guardian. Two nurses also died when missiles hit a hospital on the north end of Marat Numan. So who's to blame? The author of the strike is clearly ... either the government or Russia, says Mego Terzian, president of Doctors Without Borders in France, of the main Marat Numan attack. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu identified the Azaz missiles as Russian, the BBC reports. But Russia denies killing civilians in its support of the Assad regime, saying it only targets terrorist groups. Meanwhile, Russia's anti-rebel air assaults are aiding Assad's attempt to take Aleppoâ€”the biggest city in Syriaâ€”while civilian casualties mount.

TEST_1_131,"(Apr 10, 2015 5:40 AM CDT) Airports invested hundreds of millions of dollars in perimeter security after 9/11, and although not a single terrorist made it through, that might be because none tried, according to an AP investigation. Since 2004, there have been at least 268 perimeter breaches at America's 31 busiest airports, with intruders including drunk drivers, people taking shortcuts, stowaways, skateboarders, a mentally ill man who hopped the fence eight times at LAX in the space of less than a year, and a man who went through Washington's Reagan National Airport to recharge his boat's battery after it failed, according to an AP snapshot of cases. The intruders sneaked past security posts, rammed gates, climbed fences, and, in one case in Florida, dug under a fence. At least 44 intruders made it as far as runways or gate areas, according to the AP, which notes that the total is probably an undercount: Two airports didn't provide full information, and Boston's Logan Airport refused to provide any at all for security reasons. Airport officials say the fact that intruders were caught shows that security systems generally work well, although for security reasons, not many airports would say how long it took to catch them. San Francisco was the most breached airport in the years looked at, with 37 cases, with LAX and San Jose International Airport also high on the list, reports the Los Angeles Times. A teen stowaway who climbed a fence at San Jose survived a flight to Hawaii inside a wheel well."

Officials in the Turkish capital said a suspected suicide bomber detonated an explosive in front of the embassy, killing himself and one other person at the entrance gate. US Ambassador Francis Ricciardione identified the other death as an embassy guard. No Americans were believed to be injured in the attack, officials said, but a female Turkish journalist was also seriously wounded and two other guards sustained lighter wounds. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Turkey's interior minister, Muammer Guler, said the bomber was likely connected to a domestic left-wing militant group. He did not explain why.

Researchers at the University of Utah gave mice a diet of 25% sugarâ€”equivalent to three extra sodas per day in peopleâ€”and found the males less likely to reproduce or defend their territory, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Females had it worse, dying at double their normal rate. And to think, the National Research Council tells us that this level of added sugar is considered safe in humans. Added sugar consumed at concentrations currently considered safe exerts dramatic adverse impacts on mammalian health, the study says, according to Science Daily. Yet the mice weren't fatter and would have passed physicals, despite the negative health impactsâ€”so the sugar's toxic damage is all under the hood. Why rely on a study of mice? They're considered roughly equivalent to humans in dietary studies because they've had a similar diet to ours for about 10,000 years, and up to 80% of what's toxic to them is toxic to people, too."

It's another thing entirely to win a game you've never played before. Christian Pham of St. Paul, Minn., did exactly that Thursday, rising to the top of 219 players, including a few poker icons. By accident. The 40-year-old professional poker player says he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold 'em but inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball. The cost? A $1,500 buy-in. It's a totally different game. Different mindset. Different strategies, says a dealer. Essentially, the goal is to have the lowest poker hand, no straights or flushes, and if a player ends up with a pair, it's better if it's a pair of twos. Players can also draw cards. Pham says he didn't realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two. He panicked, then observed, leaning on helpful players who advised him what beat what. At first you suspect an act, but if it was, it was very good, says Chris Mecklin, who was sitting next to Pham when the newbie realized he had made a mistake. He didn't know it would be a fortuitous one. Pham, who moved to the US from Vietnam 15 years ago, says the guidance from his fellow players at the table helped, and he studied up the night in between the two-day contest. In the end, he says it was his tournament acumen for when and how much to bet and manage his chips that got him to the top. On Friday, he was $81,314 richer and held up his gold bracelet."

When asked to associate positive and negative adjectives with each figure, the girls assigned an average of 3.1 negative and 1.2 positive words to the fat figures, but only 1.2 negative and 2.7 positive words to the thin ones. The girls were also more likely to choose the thin figure when asked who they would want to play with or have as a best friend. And when it came time to play a board game, some of the girls were so reluctant to play as the fat character that they wouldn't even touch the figure when asked to switchâ€”some even said things like, I hate her, she has a fat stomach.

Bernie Sanders as too uncompromising and say Warren has the courage and conviction to bring Democrats, Republicans, and independents behind her proposals. There are plenty of progressives who are hungry for major change but may harbor lingering concerns about a messenger as divisive as Mr. Sanders, they write, and many more moderate Democratic primary voters see Warren as someone who speaks to their concerns about inequality and corruption. As for centrists, the Times says Joe Biden's agenda merely tinkers at the edges of issues like health care and climate and at 77, it is time for him to pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders. But Klobuchar, a standard-bearer for the Democratic center, could represent the best chance to enact many progressive plans. The Minnesotan is the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit, and sticktoitiveness, they write. Her lengthy tenure in the Senate and bipartisan credentials would make her a deal maker (a real one) and uniter for the wings of the partyâ€”and perhaps the nation.

More than half of Asian Americans and nearly half of Hispanic Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed, according to a press release from the National Institutes of Health. Live Science reports Asian Americans may have so many cases of undiagnosed diabetes because they develop it at a lower BMI than other ethnic groups, which means doctors may not be screening Asian Americans who have the disease but don't appear obese.

Layoffs have nudged the male unemployment rate to 8.8% while the female rate sits at 7%, as females tend to hold more cyclically stable jobs. Men have taken the brunt of the blow because they dominate industries hit hardest by the downturn; 90% of construction workers and 70% of manufacturing workers are male, and those sectors have shed nearly 2.5 million jobs. Women dominate in health care and education, the most stable sectors. The unemployment gap usually remains narrow, with both rates hovering around 5%. The new trend means women soon could overtake men as the majority of the US labor force, the FT notes."
TEST_1_148,"(Dec 13, 2012 12:32 PM) Residents of what is now Poland figured out how to make cheese about 7,500 years ago, reports the BBC. Archeologists have determined that clay vessels unearthed near a river were used to separate curds from whey, a key step in the process. The finding is the earliest such proof of cheese-making, and it would have been a huge innovation in the late Neolothic period, explains the LA Times. For one thing, most adults were lactose-intolerant at the time, and turning milk into cheese would make it easier to digest and thus be an important source of food. (It probably had the consistency of modern cottage cheese.) The discovery also may have helped dairy farming take hold. Ars Technica has more on how the University of Bristol researchers concluded that the pots were used to process milk."

Two of the men, known only as Arjun and Lakki, were arrested in the tourist town, while Som Bahadur Tamang was arrested some 70 miles south, the Wall Street Journal reports. The three, described as being in their early 20s, haven't yet been formally charged. Circumstantial evidence and forensic evidence links all three men to the scene of the crime, says a police superintendent. Authorities are testing forensic evidence from a small truck they seized. The truck has a broken windshield and torn seats which are reportedly evidence in the case; police also used mobile phone records to track down those arrested. According to police, the truck's owner said he employed Arjun, and the other two men are thought to be Arjun's friends. Rape cases in India have hurt the country's tourist trade lately, the Journal notes, with travel agencies seeing a 25% drop in the first three months of 2013 compared to the year before.

Vito LaPinta was called into his schoolâ€™s office on Friday and met by an agent who wanted to know his name, date of birth, Facebook name, and if there was anything else on my Facebook, LaPinta tells the local Fox station. Turns out the feds were suspicious of the 7th-grader because of a status update he posted following the killing of Osama bin Laden. A US Attorney spokesperson says that part of LaPintaâ€™s post read, First order, suicide bomb Obama. Suck it! But LaPinta says, I was saying how Osamaâ€™s dead and for Obama to be careful â€˜cause there might be suicide bombers. Mom Timi Robertson says she understands why the agents wanted to ask her son about the post, but thinks the school should have alerted her before the interrogation started.

The Oklahoma 2-year-old had been suffering a low-grade fever for a few days, but on Saturday she was fine, her grandfather, Kent Vice, tells the Tulsa World. It was a perfect Christmas. When she started throwing up blood and her skin started turning blue, Brianna's parents called an ambulance and she was rushed to the hospital and into surgery. But doctors couldn't stop the internal bleeding she was experiencing. The culprit? Though an official cause of death is still pending an autopsy, an X-ray showed Brianna had swallowed a button battery. Vice says the family was told the toddler had probably ingested the battery sometime within six days of her death, and doctors believed the battery (acid) ate through to her carotid artery by way of her esophagus. Just days before Brianna's death, a leading pediatric surgeon in the UK warned of the dangers of button batteriesâ€”small, shiny lithium batteries referred to as buttons because of their size and shape. Parents need to be aware of the risk, Martin Elliott tells the Independent. Children are going to get presents and presents are going to contain more button batteries. ... Donâ€™t let [kids] fiddle with the battery compartment of toys. Vice agrees: I want to keep these things out of houses, he says. They are dangerous.

That number is likely to fluctuate as the story develops: Al Jazeera and Reuters report the death count as being at least seven, with at least 19 but up to 27 injured, per state TV. Police and medical officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated that 50 to 75 people were trapped inside the Jawhara Mall, per the AP. Those officials said gunmen could be seen on the roof of the mall, adding that at least three police were among the dead. Meanwhile, an interior ministry rep cited on state TV said security forces were surrounding the mall, which the rep called the site of a terrorist attack, Reuters notes.

The Commerce Department has revised its estimate down to 2.8% from 3.5% on evidence that stimulus programs like Cash for Clunkers and the homebuyers' tax credit did not spur as much spending as previously thought. Still, home spending was up 19.5%, and durable goods spending up 20.1%. The new, more anemic numbers reinforce the widely-held belief that the economy is not rebounding fast enough to reverse the unemployment trend. The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly, Ben Bernanke tells the AP.

We shared the news with friends and even posted a picture on social media, he tells People. Never did he imagine that their newborn would live just six short days. Weeks after his daughter's death on June 9, Rogers of the Randy Rogers Band is speaking about the heartbreak he and his wife Chelsea felt when Rumer wouldn't eat or open her eyes. Doctors told the couple that it was normal for a baby act as though she was still in the womb, and she was put on a feeding tube. But suddenly, she stopped breathing and had to be put on a ventilator. Test after test provided no answers, he says. It was a six-day process. It was heart-wrenching and grueling not knowing what was wrong. Doctors soon came back with awful news. Rumer had an incurable genetic disorder affecting the brain, known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia, which is found in about 1 in 66,000 babies annually in the US and, according to NKH Network, affects a child's ability to break down the amino acid glycine. Chelsea and I always thought that we were two peas in a pod, says Rogers. Turns out literally we are, genetically; we have the same exact recessed gene. The odds are astronomical. The couple, who have two other daughters, Isabel, 5, and River, 21 months, say they can still have more children, but will now use in-vitro fertilization and genetic testing to ensure no one else in our family will have to have that happen to them, Rogers says. In the meantime, Rogers has created a fund to provide nesting suites for families of babies at Seton Medical Center Austin, like the one the couple used. This is something every hospital in the country should have, he says. On Twitter, he thanks People for giving our family the opportunity to tell our story and answer so many questions.

The individuals charged in this plot were intent on using violence to express their ideological views, the FBI's Cleveland chief said in a statement. The public was never in any danger; an undercover FBI agent had been monitoring the group for some time, and had provided the explosives, which were actually inert, MSNBC reports.

The Verge reports scientists from Washington University in St. Louis have created a new map of the human brain that includes 97 areas never before identified. They published their findings Wednesday in Nature. A professor at Yale calls the new mapâ€”which Wired says sort of looks like a page from an adult coloring book â€”a huge leap in neuroscience. The map gives new detail to the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for motion, senses, emotions, and problem solving. Scientists hope it will help clarify how different parts of the brain impact human behavior, Popular Science reports. For example, researchers could use the map to find what areas are different between the brains of people with and without learning disabilities. Scientists created the new map by combining three different imaging techniques used on the brains of 210 young adults. No one's done this across the whole human brain, the study's author, Matt Glasser, tells Wired. The result is a map of 180 cortical areas in each of the brain's hemispheresâ€”more than half of them completely new. In fact, they're not even sure what some of them do. For example, one cortical area is activated by relaxing but deactivated by math problems for some reason. While the new map doubles the amount of mapped areas in the brain, the scientists behind it think further research will reveal even more.

The sailors from the 42-foot Walkabout made it onto the Maston Inc. container ship yesterday morning and were in good condition, according to the US Coast Guard. Crew members from the Matsonâ€”who had made it to the sailboat the night before but had to wait till dawn to make the rescueâ€”positioned the massive container ship so it wouldn't knock over the Walkabout, then tied a rope around a life raft and sent it to the sailboat, a petty officer for the Coast Guard says.

The Coast Guard said it received the mens' message for help Sunday morning after the Walkabout became disabled during its trip from California to Hawaii and started taking on water about 400 miles northeast of Oahu. The storm was so fierce it ripped off one of the sailboat's hatches, broke its mast, and tossed its lifeboat overboard. The Coast Guard, which said it was too far away to send a helicopter, coordinated the rescue with the Matson, which was on its way from California to Honolulu to deliver goods.

The bombing, claimed by ISIS, was the deadliest terror attack in Iraq in a year and one of the worst single bombings in more than a decade of war and insurgency, the AP reports. It underscored the militants' ability to strike the Iraqi capital despite a string of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country and fueled public anger toward the political leadership. The suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden vehicle in Baghdad's mostly Shiite Karada district, a favorite avenue for shoppersâ€”especially during the holy month of Ramadan, with the streets and sidewalks filled with young people and families after they had broken their daylight fast. Police and health officials said Monday the toll stood at 142, with 185 wounded, but it is likely to increase even further as rescuers are still looking for missing people. Hours after the bombing, al-Abadi visited the attack site, but a furious mob surrounded his convoy, yelling expletives, hurling rocks and shoes at the prime minister's cars, and calling him a thief.

As the New York Times reports, her discovery offers the earliest example of chocolate use north of the Mexican border. Crown submitted fragments of the jars to a lab at Hershey's, which found traces of cacao using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The presence of chocolate in the modern United States testifies to a robust trading network throughout the Americas, especially for luxury goods like cacao beansâ€”whose expense justified the fine earthenware. Itâ€™s as if you were having a dinner party and serving champagne, said one museum curator."

So far, 32 bodies have been found, but another 170 are missing, reports AFP. Authorities fear most were trapped inside the ferry after it collided with a cargo ship near the busy port city of Cebu and sank within 10 minutes. As bad as the numbers are, they could be much worse: The ferry had 831 passengers and crew on board, most of whom were rescued from the water. There is a blind spot there, and each ship passing through needs to give way in a portion of that narrow strip, says a government official. The ferry was entering the port and the cargo ship leaving, and the official speculates that one of the vessels ventured into the wrong shipping lane. Philippines has an awful track record on maritime safety, and Reuters reports that it's not unusual for dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people to die each year in ferry accidents. They're a common mode of travel from island to island, and the one involved in yesterday's accident had been in operation for 40 years."

Abductor Phillip Garrido, 58, admitted to fathering two girls, now 15 and 11, with Dugard; she and the children were kept hidden in a shed and various outbuildings in Garrido's yard in a San Francisco suburb. None of the children had ever gone to school, they had never been to a doctor, they were in complete isolation, said one law-enforcement official, adding that the girls were born on the compound. Authorities uncovered the abduction after Garrido, a registered sex offender, showed up for a parole hearing with two womenâ€”his wife, Nancy, 54, now also under arrest, and Dugard."

CBC reports Barnaby bravely used a protective mother bear to get rid of the hungry wolf that had been stalking her through the woods for 12 hours. The ordeal started last Friday when Barnaby was out picking mushrooms with her dog, Joey. They were heading back to her truck when Barnaby heard growling and turned around to see a very skinny wolf. His legs were spread and his hair was standing, and he was growling, and baring his teeth, Barnaby says. The wolf started pacing in front of her, herding her and Joey away from her truck and the highway. It took me a while to realize that he knew what he was doing. He was trying to wear me down. The wolf pursued Barnaby for 12 hours. He was dogged. He was just determined. Then, around 4:30am, Barnaby heard a mother bear and cub calling to each other from a distance. I realized that there was a chance that the mother bear would tackle the wolf if she felt that the wolf was a threat. Barnaby headed toward the cub and before long heard crashing in the forest behind her. I could hear the wolf yelping, and I could hear the mama bear growling, and I could hear all this crashing, and I just took off. Barnaby and Joey eventually made it back to the highway, where they were rescued by a mountie. Read the full story for Barnaby's thoughts on mosquitoes, beer, and always bringing your gun."

The photos of seven freshmen cadets dressed in white pants and shirts with the pillowcases surfaced on social media last month. An investigation found they were ordered by upperclassmen to sing Christmas carols while they were dressed in costumes as part of a Ghosts of Christmas Past skit, the AP reports. The investigation found that the cadets did not intend to be offensive. However, I am disappointed some recognized how it could be construed as such but didn't stop it, college President retired Lt. Gen John Rosa says in a statement. The song sheets contained only the words to carols and nothing offensive and at the outset, not all of the freshmen understood that the costumes could be construed by some as offensive, he says. Rosa says while the skit had no ill intent, it did show poor judgment. It demonstrates that we must integrate an even higher level of diversity education into cadets' daily activities. He announced formation of a task force comprised of representatives from the school and the community to study and make recommendations on the campus climate for minorities, enhancing the curriculum to promote greater understanding of ethnic backgrounds, and increasing diversity among students and staff. School officials said one junior has been dismissed from the college. Two upperclassmen were suspended and must leave for a semester. The other cadets are being punished by marching back and forth in the barracks shouldering guns for 50 minutes at a time. Some will have to march tours for three weeks, others until the end of the semester."

Sarah Lane, a performer with the American Ballet Theatre, now says she performed some 95% of the full body shot dances in Black Swan. I would say 5% are Natalie, says Lane. From a professional dancer's standpoint, she doesn't look like a professional ballet dancer at all, and she can't dance in pointe shoes. And she can't move her bodyâ€”she's very stiff. Ouch. Lane says she was warned by the producers not to talk about how much she danced, reports ABC News. Lane lashed out after Portman's fiancÃ©, Benjamin Millepied, boasted recently that the Academy Award-winning actress was largely responsible for the dance scenes. Articles now talking about her dance double are making it sound like Lane did a lot of the work but really, she just did the footwork, and one diagonal in the studio, Millepied said. Honestly, 85% of that movie was Natalie. Lane was only named in the movie credits as Hand Model, Stunt Double, and Lady in the Lane. Producer Fox Searchlight issued a statement denying Lane's remarks; click for more on that."

That's up from 602 in 2000, the New York Times notes. The report cites anger over shifting racial demographics, the income gap, and President Obama as the catalyst for the increase. Anti-government groups aligned with the patriot or militia movements are also exploding: There were 1,274 in operation last year, a stunning increase from 824 the year prior. The anti-government organizations represent both a kind of right-wing populist rage and a left-wing populist rage that has gotten all mixed up in anger toward the government, says the report's author. The far-right spectrum of the movement had peaked in 1995, following the incidents at Ruby Ridge, Waco, and Oklahoma City, but has picked up steam again since the recession began in 2008. The SPLC has been tracking these types of groups for 30 years and only includes active groupsâ€”those that are registering new members, staging protests, or distributing literatureâ€”in its report."

The attackers targeted an old section of Bayero University's campus where religious groups use a theater and other areas to hold worship services, Kano state police spokesman Ibrahim Idris said. The assault left many others seriously wounded, Idris said. By the time we responded, they entered (their) motorcycles and disappeared into the neighborhood, the commissioner said. After the attack, police and soldiers cordoned off the campus as gunfire echoed in the surrounding streets. No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, Idris said the attackers used small explosives packed inside of aluminum soda cans for the assault, a method previously used by a radical Islamist sect known as Boko Haram."

Saramago was an outspoken man who antagonized many, and saw his popularity at home dampened by his unflinching support for Communism, blunt manner, and sometimes difficult prose styl People used to say about me, 'He's good but he's a Communist.' Now they say, 'He's a Communist but he's good,' he said in a 1998 interview with the AP. International critical acclaim came late in his life, starting with his 1982 historical fantasy Memorial do Convento, published in English in 1988 as Baltasar and Blimunda. He was frequently compared to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his writing is often described as realism tinged with Latin-American mysticism, particularly for his technique of confronting historical personages with fictional characters."

Christie's also sold a Rembrandt portrait for $33.2 million, showing that collectors are going after older masterpieces while the market for living artists remains shaky, the Wall Street Journal reports. Raphael's Head of a Muse, a rare black chalk drawing of a woman's head, created around 1511 as a study for a fresco in the Vatican, is especially coveted as the only drawing from its series in private handsâ€”the others all belong to the Louvre.

The Tokyo store will also serve a Truffle and Porcini Grilled Chicken Sandwich and a wasabi-avocado burger, reports the Wall Street Journal. The paper explains that Wendy's pulled out of Japan in 2009, shuttering its 71 stores. This time around, it has teamed up with a new partner (which also happens to be behind the country's Domino's) and has plans to blanket 700 stores throughout the country. If you're interested in the luxurious burger, though, you'll have to make a trip overseas.

In recapping the stabbing of Maria Caleel, the Chicago Tribune also reveals for the first time the veterinary student's last words to a police officer on the scene: I can't believe he did this to me. While that might suggest Caleel knew her killer, police aren't ruling anything out. Detectives have been able to retest evidence from the scene to establish the DNA profile of an unknown male. They've also been collecting samples, sometimes secretly, from possible suspects and are now awaiting results from the state crime lab. Among the facts of the case: Caleel suffered a single stab wound and managed to crawl through the apartment hall to her neighbors' place. She wasn't sexually assaulted or robbed, and there was no sign of a struggle in her apartment. Among the possible suspects: a fellow veterinary student who might have resented her and an unidentified male named in an anonymous letter sent to police four years ago. The lead detective will say only this of the DNA evidence that might crack the case: It was in a place where we would have expected it to have been left by the suspect.

The family soon forgot about the incidentâ€”until the tiny piece came out of his nose almost two years later. Mudassir Anwar, father of 7-year-old Sameer, tells the New Zealand Herald that the Lego piece, believed to be a character's arm, resurfaced when Sameer sniffed a cupcake and felt a pain in his nose. His mother helped him blow his noseâ€”and was surprised when what came out wasn't cake crumbs, but the Lego piece, now covered in fungus. Sameer's parents say he didn't complain of any discomfort during the years the Lego was up his nose. We never expected such a thing, Anwar tells the Guardian. The Lego piece looks a bit gross but thatâ€™s how it is. Unbelievable. The parents say Sameer was amazed to see the piece again. His eyes were wide open and he was like, Mum, I found the Lego!

The insider threats include both active and reserve military members, but also people who have access to military facilities such as contractors or relatives with special ID cards. The information was revealed in a closed-door House-Senate committee hearing late last year, according to three sources. I was surprised and struck by the numbers; they were larger than I expected, said Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, who declined to confirm the numbers.

The decline has renewed debate about whether 401(k) plans, heavily linked to the market and heavily pushed by the government, are smart retirement investments. The loss of retirement security is a reversal of fortune and the result of very specific flawed governmental policies that have been biased toward 401(k) plans, said one professor. Markets do go up and down, and 401(k) participants must try to remember to think long-term, countered one consultant.

TEST_1_205,"(Nov 30, 2015 9:48 AM) Japan is wasting little time in resuming its scientific whale hunte: Its whaling fleet will leave Tuesday for the Antarctic for a three-month, scaled-down hunt, the government says, despite protests. Monday's announcement comes days after Japan submitted its final plan to the International Whaling Commission after the commission's scientific committee said earlier this year it wasn't convinced that whales needed to be killed for research on whale stock management and conservation. Japan says lethal sampling is indispensable to obtain data on the maturing ages of whales. The IWC imposed a commercial ban on whaling in 1986, but Japan has continued to kill whales under a research exemption. This will be the first expedition since the International Court of Justice ruled last year that they weren't truly scientific, forcing Tokyo to revise its Antarctic whaling plans. Last year, Japan did go to the Antarctic, but didn't kill any whales. Japan's actual catch has fallen in recent years in part because of declining domestic demand for whale meat; protests by anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd have also contributed. Tokyo plans to catch up to 333 minke whales each year over the next 12 years, about one-third of what it used to, the Fisheries Agency and the Foreign Ministry said Monday. The plan will be evaluated after six years. Fifteen environmental and animal rights groups say in a statement that Tokyo should stop using taxpayer money to keep the debt-ridden whaling operation alive. We strongly demand that the government not start any new research whaling programs, and instead take on new measures that contribute to ocean conservation, they say. Australia, which brought the ICJ case against Japan, said it might send a boat to shadow the Japanese fleet."

TEST_1_213,"(Sep 5, 2009 6:45 AM CDT) The teen jobless picture is the bleakest since the government started tracking the statistic 60 years ago, the New York Times reports. The rate hit 25.5% last month, nearly triple the rate among other workers. Analysts say teens are getting squeezed out of the workplace by college graduates, unable to find more lucrative work, taking jobs they might otherwise have shunned, and by older workers hanging onto their jobs instead of retiring. The dismal employment outlook has the silver lining of getting more young people to opt for college, although with few jobs to be had, many can't afford to. Youth employment never fully recovered from the 2001 recession, and experts don't expect things to improve any time soon. Given that unemployment is a lagging indicator, one expert says, and young peopleâ€™s unemployment even lags behind the rest of unemployment, weâ€™re going to see a lot of kids out of work for a long, long, long, long time."

The crucifixions took place in a town square in Aleppo, where the militants said the bodies would hang for three days, Reuters reports. ISIS also crucified another man in al-Bab, a town near the Turkish border, but he survived. Meanwhile, another of America's geopolitical foes has joined the fight against ISIS in Iraq. Russia has sent 12 new warplanes to bolster Nouri al-Maliki's forces, along with experts to help get them in the air, in what the New York Times sees as at least an implicit rebuke to the United States. Iraq has complained that the US has been slow to send its own aircraft, though it is in the process of doing so."
TEST_1_216,"(Apr 28, 2015 11:44 PM CDT) Bill shock doesn't just happen to cellphone users: Ron Dorff, an 83-year-old Los Angeles man driven to despair by a $24,298.93 bill for a dial-up Internet service that usually costs him $51 a month, was initially told he would have to pay up, according to Los Angeles Times consumer advocate David Lazarus. After a technician determined there was a problem with the modem Dorff used to access the AOL service, the elderly man says he was told AT&T would not adjust the massive bill, according to Lazarus, who says the company waived the charges after he stepped in. A spokesman says Dorff's modem had somehow started calling a long-distance number when it accessed AOL, racking up hefty charges for every minute he was online. Whatever the issue was, Lazarus thinks AT&T could have done a lot better. I don't care if Dorff was making daily calls to the International Space Station, he writes. The simple fact is that AT&T allowed a customer's bill to become so over the top as to be laughable, then dug in its heels when the customerâ€”who lives off Social Security checksâ€”tried to deal with it. He adds that he was surprised to discover that Dorff is one of 2.2 million people still using AOL dial-up service. A few years ago, the FCC was looking into ways to prevent bill shock, but nothing appears to have come from the effort, Gizmodo reports. (A Washington state man was hit with an outstanding toll-bridge bill of more than $18,000.)"

Cubitat is a 10-by-10-by-10-foot cube, and it's got practically everything you need built in, Treehugger reports. One side has a whole kitchen, with a sink, dishwasher, fridge, and more, all in a single wall. Another side features a pullout bed from which you can watch a TV mounted in a nook. Need a bathroom? The cube's got a built-in toilet. It even features a laundry machine and storage space. You'll have to hook it up to plumbing and electricity, but the makersâ€”a Toronto firm called Urban Capital and a designer named Luca Nichettoâ€”say the idea of Cubitat is a plug and play space, Slate reports. They call it, per CTV, the most adaptable home imagined. Cubitat is about a more intelligent, holistic way to design and construct our living environments, taking cues from the prefab world and modern production methods, says an Urban Capital developer. As a builder we look at the automotive, consumer product, and tech industries and ask why we canâ€™t operate with that much rapidity and flexibility. Among the minor kinks to be worked out: How do you fit a 10-foot cube through your door? Well, maybe you won't have to: The idea is to hoist and slide Cubitat onto a condo floor mid-construction, says a project description, per Slate. And when you're feeling less urban, you can ship Cubitat from the city to the country so you retire in your own home. (Perhaps the designers could give some tips to the EU parliament, whose building is so confusing it's nearly left some in tears.)"

The queen has been isolating at the castle with husband Prince Philip and it is likely a small group of household staff have been isolating with her, ITV reports. Last month, sources told Vanity Fair that the Queen has been riding almost every day and is keen to return to public duties. She canâ€™t be seen to be going against official government advice, but itâ€™s fair to say sheâ€™s looking forward to getting back to normal, one royal source said. Itâ€™s a delicate line but I think we will see her doing private audiences again and more of the work we are used to seeing her do in public at some point in the future."

TEST_1_225,"(Oct 20, 2015 3:00 AM CDT) Life of one kind or another has been around on this planet for 300 million years longer than thought, according to US researchers who took a close look at some incredibly ancient crystals unearthed in Australia. The scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic, Reuters reports. That's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself, roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Before now, the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old. There's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed, the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the Hadean, after Hades, because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed, the New Scientist notes. The UCLA and Stanford researchers now dispute that, saying life on Earth may have formed almost instantaneously â€”and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point. The early Earth certainly wasn't a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that, study co-author Mark Harrison says in a UCLA press release. The planet was probably much more like it is today than previously thought. (Earth's first big predator may have been an enormous sea scorpion.)"

Hackers reportedly stole a third-party vendor's login credentials to access Home Depot's network and install malware on self-checkout registers that then accessed the credit card and email data. It was designed to evade antivirus software, but Home Depot says the malware has been eliminated, reports USA Today. The security breach was bigger than Target's in 2013, which exposed 40 million credit and debit cards. Michaels, SuperValu, and Neiman Marcus have also been targeted in similar but smaller breaches. Home Depot's stock rose 5 cents yesterday, while shares have gained 18% this year. It's due to announce fiscal third-quarter results on Nov. 18. (Home Depot previously announced its customers won't be liable for fraudulent credit card charges.)"
TEST_1_250,"(Feb 19, 2020 7:15 PM) Two women were killed this week when the car they were sitting in fell off a ferry in Miami. The car sank to the bottom of the 50-foot channel, the Herald reports, where Miami-Dade Fire Rescue divers found their bodies. It's not clear how the Mercedes went into the water, but a witness said the ferry was open at both ends. The 113-foot ferry's trip from Fisher Island to Miami Beach takes only 7 minutes. The ferry, the Pelican, passed a Coast Guard inspection in 2018. With the exception of a yacht, the ferry is the only way to reach the island, a wealthy enclave of fewer than 500 residents. The Coast Guard and Miami-Dade police are investigating. The victims in the Tuesday afternoon accident were socialites Emma Afra, 63, who lived on Fisher Island, and Viviane Brahms, 75, per Vanity Fair. Afra was involved in several local charities. The entire Fisher Island community mourns their loss, the president of the island association said."

After the female African lion named Isis didn't show any signs of recovery from the 15-foot fall, the zoo's veterinary staff decided to euthanize her, the Chicago Tribune reported. Zoo staff said her death was unexpected, mysterious and especially difficult, the AP reports. The lion was fine when staff checked on her at 9am Monday, an hour before the zoo opened, but she was found unresponsive at the bottom of the moat a half-hour later, said William Zeigler, senior vice president of animal programs. Her fall wasn't seen by anyone or caught on camera."

Which sounds like a handsome total until you consider that an estimated 25 million tons remain, reports the Wall Street Journal. The nation is now grappling with the staggering logistics of getting rid of acres of tires, plastic, twisted metal, wood, etc. The work is expected to cost $8.4 billion and take at least three years. The volume is so great, it's difficult to know what to do with it all, says a city official in hard-hit Ofunato. There's just not enough room. Complicating things: Much of the debris is contaminated with seawater (or worse, if it comes from the area near the Fukushima nuclear plant), which makes disposing of it or the resulting ash trickier. The ash, for example, can't go into cement mix if the salt content is too high. We really have no idea how long it will take, says the mayor of Rikuzentakata."

That includes about 2,000 hulking MRAPsâ€”mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles that cost $1 million apiece. The excess equipment is being turned into scrap metal. Why not leave it for the Afghan army? The Pentagon is concerned the Afghan forces wouldn't be able to maintain it. The US could donate the stuff to other allied nations, but rules require recipient nations to go get it themselves in Afghanistan, and that's apparently too hard to make happen before the 2014 withdrawal. Hence, scrap yards in Afghanistan are extremely busy these days."

The contract was awarded to a European-American partnership, but US-based Boeing successfully contested that decision, in part thanks to public outcry. Reason finally prevailed, one analyst told Bloomberg, calling the delay the right thing to do. The reprieve gives Boeing more time to get its proposal in order, and a victory by Barack Obama might give an edge to the jet-maker headquartered in his home state. John McCain might instead favor Northrop Grumman; McCain spearheaded a 2004 investigation into Boeing that put the contract up for grabs."

Dyton Logalbo was playing outside near his home around 2pm Saturday when his mom saw him wandering into the cornfield north of Antigo, reports the Wausau Daily Herald. She alerted authorities when she couldn't find him on her own. Policeâ€”who searched with helicopters, drones, and K9 unitsâ€”didn't even need to ask for volunteers, per the Antigo Times. Unprompted, some 500 people signed up to search before Dyton was found Sunday morning, police say. Tom Andraschko says he was searching a section of the cornfield with 70 others around 10:30am when he found the toddler sitting cross-legged on the ground. He was cold, wet, and scared, but otherwise in good health, though he was taken to a local hospital as a precaution. I asked my wife if she thought I should come this morning, if they need any help, Andraschko, a father of 2-year-old twins, told WAOW on Sunday. She said, 'Well, if it were your kids, how many people would you want to come?' So I came right away. A sheriff praised the caring and compassion of the community for helping get Dyton home safely.

A number of party guests performed CPR on the girl before she was transported to the hospital, where a large marshmallow was found lodged in her throat. Azriel died without ever regaining consciousness. She had hit her head when she passed out, severely injuring her head, WPXI reports. Estabrooks blames the party's hosts for her daughter's death, claiming they were negligent in not keeping an eye on Azriel. They didnâ€™t find her in time, she tells WCVB. Someone didn't realize she was choking on a marshmallow. She was already on the floor passed out by the time anyone found her. Doctors believe oxygen had already been cut off to Azriel's brain before any aid was given. Estabrooks told NBC 10 News on Wednesday that the hosts of the party never called to check on Azriel while she was in the hospital.

William Flynn was 16-year-old Billy in 1990 when he and three teenage friends carried out what prosecutors said was Pamela Smart's plot to murder Gregg Smart in New Hampshire. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus time served before trial. The trial was a media circus and one of the first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between an instructor and student. It inspired the Joyce Maynard novel To Die For, which in turn was made into a movie starring Nicole Kidman. The board granted Flynn parole on his first attempt today, his 41st birthday. He has been in a Maine prison and participated in the hearing by telephone, telling the board that he'd always be haunted by the killing. Pamela Smart, who was 22 when her husband was killed, was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. Smart was one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program when she first seduced him when he was 15; Flynn testified that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. On May 1, 1990, Flynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released."

The organization announced Tuesday that the American hairless terrier and the sloughi have joined 187 other recognized breeds. The newcomers can now compete in most AKC shows and competitions, though not at the prominent Westminster Kennel Club show until next year. Many American hairless terriers are, as advertised, bare-skinned, though others have short coats but carry the hairless gene. Their rise began when a hairless puppy emerged in a litter of rat terriers in the 1970s, wowing a Louisiana couple and leading to deliberate breeding of the hairless dogs, according to the American Hairless Terrier Club of America. They're terrier-smart but somewhat calmer than some other terrier breeds, says a club secretary. They're very easy to live with because they're very trainable. The sloughiâ€”pronounced SLOO-gheeâ€”also called the Arabian greyhound, was developed to hunt game as big as gazelles. The lean, leggy dogs have some similarities to Salukis, another hound breed from North Africa. Sloughis are known for speed, endurance, grace, and rather reserved demeanors."

On the night of Nov. 9, 1989, thousands of East Berliners streamed through the once-closed border crossings after communist authorities caved to mounting pressure. It was about reclaiming freedom, about being citizens, not subjects, Merkel said at the main memorial site for the Wall on Bernauer Strasse. The fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true, said Merkel, who grew up in East Germany. Nothing has to stay the way it is, however big the hurdles are. Activists staged a small demonstration during the memorial event, holding up a banner with the words No wall around Europe to protest the treatment of refugees trying to reach the continent. A million people were expected to attend today's festivities in Berlin, which included an open-air party at the city's Brandenburg Gate and the release of hundreds of helium-filled balloon strung along a 9-mile stretch of the former border. Merkel noted that Nov. 9 is also the day when, in 1938, Nazi paramilitaries launched a pogrom against the country's Jewish population in what became known as Reichskristallnachtâ€”the Night of Broken Glass.

The $8 million Nereus was in the Kermadec Trench northeast of New Zealand, among the world's deepest spots, when it went missing on Saturday afternoon. Debris found at the surface indicates that at least part of the hybrid remotely operated vehicle likely imploded under pressure as great as 16,000 pounds per square inch.

Thompson lost contact with the Nereus during a planned nine-hour dive of the deepest extent of the trench. The debris spotted by the ship will be analyzed to verify its source and to attempt to find clues in the Nereus' demise. Among the standout details of the vehicle, which was built in 2008: It is one of just four submersibles to ever reach the deepest part of the ocean in the Mariana Trench; it has collected specimens of animals previously unknown to science; and it explored the world's deepest known hydrothermal vents along the Caribbean's Cayman Rise.

A private partyâ€”the celebration of an out-of-town couple's one-year anniversaryâ€”was one of several taking place at the City Grill when shots erupted around 2:30am. One of the victims was the newlywed husband. Later, police raided a city home and took an apparent suspect into custody but didn't provide any details. It's just a senseless killing, the father of 32-year-old victim Tiffany Wilhite tells the News. A senseless, random killing.

Sirte residents who initially discovered the bodies on Friday identified one as a former Gadhafi government official, and said they believed some of the victims were Gadhafi supporters who had probably been attempting to escape the district.

At age 16, Ivins Rosier confessed to breaking into the home of Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody in West Palm Beach and shooting the 5-year-old German Shepherd, the newspaper noted in May. Rosier's attorney argued that a detective hustled the boy during interrogation by equating the dog's death to the murder of a law enforcement officer (which wasn't legally true). Rosier's attorney also wanted his client sentenced as a juvenile with a maximum sentence of 6 years, CBS 12 reports. I believe this to be sadistic to do this to a child, said Rosier's attorney, who plans to appeal. He conceded that Rosier's crimes were serious, but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile. Ultimately, Rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. A gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand, said the prosecuting attorney. He's not a child.

Funny how that notion took holdâ€”that we use a tenth of our brain at any given timeâ€”because there's no actual evidence for it, the Conversation reports. The idea may date back to psychologist William James, who wrote in 1907 that we use only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources, and a foreword to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People that loosely quoted James as saying that the average person develops only 10% of his latent mental ability. Now, products exist to unlock the other 90% and a new thriller, Lucy, shows Scarlett Johansson taking drugs that enable her to use all 100% of her brain. But, as the Atlantic reports, scientists point out that the brain is an organ packed with living neurons that are always up to something. Brain scans that show only a small active portion of gray matter lighting up may confuse people, one neuroscience professor points out, because they show only the brain's major activities, not all of them. Yet those kinds of ideas self-perpetuate, he says. One possible basis for the 10% notion: The brain has almost 100 billion neurons, which are outnumbered roughly 10:1 by glial cells that keep the brain working. In other words, the Conversation notes, neurons are only 10% of our entire brain. (See how lack of sleep can fry brain cells.)"

The pigs have been part of the landscape since the 1600s, when early settlers allowed them to roam; some escaped, though their numbers have long been relatively few and largely limited to the South. It's unclear what's behind the recent surge, but experts are working hard to find a way to contain them, Scientific American reports. Between the damage they cause and efforts to control them, wild pigs cost some $1.5 billion per year. In addition to eating crops, they can ruin fields by digging, threaten local species, and contaminate streams with their feces. I've never seen any one species that can affect so many livelihoods and resources, says a Texas official. The federal government is directing $20 million toward thinning their ranks. The USDA program involves destroying the wild pig population in two states every few years, starting with the states that have the fewest pigs.

TEST_1_318,"(Oct 4, 2011 2:07 AM CDT) A surge in support for Herman Cain and an equally dramatic drop in support for Rick Perry has left the pair tied in second place among GOP candidates with 12% each, according to the latest Washington Post poll, which finds Mitt Romney in first place with 25%. Support for the Texas governor has dropped by a hefty 13 points over the last month, while Cain's backing is up 12 points, according to the poll, which was mostly conducted before the controversy about the Perry ranch name. The only other candidate in double figures is Ron Paul, with 11%, while Chris Christie and Sarah Palin would have 10% and 9%, respectively, if they entered the race, the poll found. Tea Partiers are largely responsible for Cain's rise and Perry's fall, with Perry's support down from 45% to 10% among the group; Cain is up to 30%. No matter who the GOP picks, Tea Partiers sense victory: Some 91% of the Tea Party supporters believe a Republican will win the White House next year, compared with 83% among Republicans as a whole. Only 58% of Democrats expect their party to come out on top."

An Israeli scholar has discovered nine tiny parchments amid the thousands of world-famous scrolls and scroll fragments that date back to the second century BCE, the Times of Israel reports. Dr. Yonatan Adler found two of the mini-scrolls at the Israel Museum in December, and announced the discovery of several more last month. Either they didnâ€™t realize that these were also scrolls, or they didnâ€™t know how to open them, one expert says. Now the Israel Antiquities Authority plans to painstakingly unravel and preserve the finds. What might they reveal? Hard to say, but scholars analyzing other Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at Qumran in the 1940s and '50s have described how the biblical texts differ from the Bible as we know it todayâ€”sometimes with additional passages. An Israeli scholar said he didn't expect any bombshells from the new scrolls, but Adler says he's still excited about them, LiveScience reports.

The paper shows that global wealth owned by the richest 1% jumped from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014, putting this elite group on track to cross the 50% mark by next year, the BBC reports. Those in the top group had an average wealth of $2.7 million per adult last year (the BBC notes that to qualify as part of that group, one needs to be worth about $750,000). Meanwhile, the poorest 80% of the world owned just 5.5% of the world's riches and claimed an average wealth of $3,851 per adult. Oxfam's research backs up a similar 2014 report from Credit Suisse, as per the BBC. The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering, Oxfam Executive Director Winnie Byanyima says in a statement. Do we really want to live in a world where the [1%] own more than the rest of us combined? Byanyima, who's co-chairing the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos this week, will underscore these points by presenting a seven-point plan for governments to narrow the gap in their own countries. Included in Oxfam's plan are calls to get tougher on corporate tax evasion, invest in free public health care and education, and lobby for equal-pay laws to help women get ahead in the workplace. The charity is hoping its report shines a light on how the richest of the rich get their money (a good chunk of it's inherited) and how they push for rules regarding money to benefit them.

Mexico's National Council for Culture for the Arts confirmed the death of Mexico's most celebrated novelist. The cause was not immediately known. His generation of writers, including Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa, drew global readership and attention to Latin American culture during a period when strongmen ruled much of the region. The prolific Fuentes wrote his first novel, Where the Air is Clear, at age 29, laying the foundation for a boom in Spanish contemporary literature during the 1960s and 1970s. The Death of Artemio Cruz, a novel about a post-revolutionary Mexico that failed to keep its promise of narrowing social gaps, brought Fuentes international notoriety. The elegant, mustachioed author's other contemporary classics included Aura, Terra Nostra, and The Good Conscience. Many American readers know him for The Old Gringo, a novel about San Francisco journalist Ambrose Bierce, who disappeared at the height of the 1910-1920 Mexican Revolution. That book was later made into a film starring Gregory Peck and Jane Fonda."

But NGOs see a different problem: a lost generation of scarred children who could plague the region for years if funding falls off. If we focus on their problems now, we may avoid decades of impairment, said a British official. And while the Zaatari camp appears well-run, the Syrians insist they don't want to stay.

According to emails from the Reedy Creek Fire Department, Matt Graves said he was attacked by a second alligator as he tried to reach his son after Lane was pulled into the water outside Disney's upscale Grand Floridian Resort. Capt. Tom Wellonsâ€”who described his interaction with the Nebraska father in emails to two supervisors that were obtained by the Orlando Sentinelâ€”said the family kept showing rescuers pictures of the boy.

Both captured in Tunisia in May 1943, they gained momentary notoriety when, moved to act in part by news that Schymalla's 60-year-old father had been conscripted to join the withering Nazi forces, they managed to escape by boat. Having dug their way under a wire fence just before midnight on a Saturday in late October, they set off from Algona-Branch Camp No. 4 near Bena, Minn. Their plan: Follow Lake Winnibigoshish to the Mississippi River to New Orleans, where they hoped to catch a ride home, reports the Minneapolis Star Tribune. They had a head start in their journey thanks to the lack of a Sunday-morning count; the search began more than 24 hours after their escape. In a 1994 article for Minnesota History magazine, historian George Lobdell wrote that having been in the state since February, the men knew they needn't fear wild animals or Indians. Unfortunately, the three small maps they found in a dictionary apparently gave no understanding of the distances involved (as evidenced by the great number of things they packed, including shoe polish and a cigarette-rolling machine). They made it 20-odd miles south in the first few days, then hit a snowstorm and ultimately took a wrong turn into Jay Gould Lake on Friday. There they were spotted by a resort owner who called the county sheriff, and they were ultimately caught hiding in bushes. Their punishment: 30 days in confinement.

Never fear: There's apparently a pretty good chance one or more of your adult children will move back in with you at some point. A Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data finds that last year, 36.4% of women from age 18 to age 34 lived with their parents or relatives. That's the highest number since at least 1940, when 36.2% such women lived with family, the AP reports. (Less newsworthy is the fact that 42.8% of young men lived with parents or relatives last yearâ€”historically, more young men have lived with family than young women, the AP explains, and 42.8% is well below the 47.5% of young men who lived with family in 1940. The percentage of young people living with family fell after the 1940s in part because marriage rates increased and the workforce expanded; more women also joined the workforce. At the time, the median age of marriage for women was 21.5. Nowadays, it's 27, which is part of the reason more adult women are living with their parents: They're half as likely to be married as women of the same age were in 1940, but are more likely to have a college education, a Pew senior economist explains. There's also the fact that they're facing student debt and a higher cost of living these days. As for men, their median age of marriage was 24.3 in 1940 and is 29.3 now. Young adults of both sexes started increasingly moving back home after 2000 thanks to the uncertainty of the job market, but the job market is better now than it was in 2010 ... and yet, more adults are living with their parents now than that year."

Researchers found 15% of the 19,000 adults in the study suffered from the disorder, with more than half of those afflicted reporting an episode at least once a week. Their answers regarding sleep habits, mental illness, and medications allowed researchers to pinpoint some risk factors, including sleep disorders, alcoholism, PTSD, antidepressants, and too much or too little sleep. About 30% reported being sleep drunk for 15 minutes or longer after waking, which raises concern about workers who nap on the jobâ€”or, say, pilots and doctors.

The haul was pulled up this month from the SS Gairsoppa, a British cargo ship that sank off the coast of Ireland in 1941 after being torpedoed by a German U-boat. Not only is it the biggest recovery in history, it's also the deepest, coming from a depth of almost three miles, the Tampa Tribune reports. If you can't picture what 61 tons of silver looks like, Bloomberg reports that it's 1,574 silver bars.

Though Gawker's Ryan Tate's take on the whole thing is a bit snarky ( Despite what anyone tells you, we're not in a tech bubble! ), VentureBeat's Anthony Ha notes that it sounds like Kaplan is really trying to invent a new model for the restaurant business, one that uses mobile technology for an experience thatâ€™s fast and flexible without sacrificing quality."
TEST_1_347,"(Mar 10, 2020 7:21 AM CDT) Two US Marines were killed Sunday in an attack on an ISIS cave complex in the mountains of north central Iraq. The unidentified Marines from an elite Raiders unit were advising Iraqi soldiers in the Qara Chockh Mountains, about 37 miles south of Erbil, when they were killed by enemy forces, officials said Monday, per NBC News and Military.com, adding four additional US troops were injured. A coalition spokesman said the recovery of the dead and wounded took some six hours, per Military.com. Officials estimated that some 15 to 19 ISIS fighters had been killed. The Iraqi military said at least 25 ISIS fighters were killed and nine tunnels and a training camp were destroyed, per the Washington Post. These are the first US combat deaths since a Marine Raider, Gunnery Sgt. Scott Koppenhafer, was killed during a mission to track an ISIS suspect in Iraq's Nineveh province in August, though two US personnel were killed in a joint operation between US and Afghan forces last month, per NBC. The Makhmur Mountains are historically known to be an ISIS safe haven. However, there is no safe place for ISIS to hide, officials said, per Military.com. The Coalition, alongside our partner forces, will continue to hunt the remnants of the illegitimate caliphate in order to disrupt any effort to resurge. There are approximately 5,200 US troops in Iraq to assist in the fight against ISIS."

Fury erupted after a group of Orthodox Jews harassed young girls on their way to school for not dressing modestly. Stop Israel from becoming Iran, said signs held by protesters in the town of Beit Shemesh west of Jerusalem, reports the BBC. President Shimon Peres expressed support for the demonstrators who aim to save the majority from the hands of a small minority, he said. No person has the right to threaten a girl, a woman, or any person in any way, he added. Schoolgirls and parents in the community have complained of harassment by groups of Orthodox men claiming the little girls are wearing immodest dress. When I walk to school in the morning I get a tummy ache because I'm so scared that they are going to start yelling and spitting, Naama Margoles, 8, told AP. Naama's story, told in a recent documentary, has infuriated Israelis. Women also report being taunted as prostitutes for wearing T-shirts and skirts. The Orthodox extremists are demanding that males and females walk on opposite sides of the street in town. Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up 10% of the Israeli population, but large families are driving up their numbers."

In a spirit of healing, the event is meant to be a catalyst for pause and reflection following the outpouring of violence that has gripped Baltimore and areas throughout the US. A rep earlier announced that Prince has also recorded a song that is a tribute to all of the people of the city of Baltimore and addresses the unrest in Baltimore and the socio/political issues around the country in the wake of a slew of killings of young black men. The Daily Beast has the lyrics to the new song, which include: Does anybody hear us pray? / For Michael Brown or Freddie Gray / Peace is more than the absence of war / Absence of war.

TEST_1_351,"(Feb 3, 2015 6:30 PM) Consumers who've been popping herbal supplements may want to take note after the New York State attorney general announced yesterday that four retail giants are selling herbal items that may be mislabeled, crammed with fillers, and potentially dangerous, the Guardian reports. Eric Schneiderman sent cease-and-desist letters to Walmart, GNC, Target, and Walgreen, ordering they remove the suspect store-brand supplementsâ€”including echinacea, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, garlic, St. John's wort, and saw palmettoâ€”from NY shelves after DNA testing found plants listed on labels were either in short supply, swapped out for cheap (and possibly allergy-inducing) substitutes such as powdered rice or wheat, or not present at all. Mislabeling, contamination, and false advertising are illegal, Schneiderman said, per the New York Times. They also pose unacceptable risks to New York familiesâ€”especially those with allergies to hidden ingredients. Almost 80% of supplements tested at the retailers didn't contain any of the herbs they claimed; Walmart fared the worst, with only 4% of its tested products adhering to label claims, the Guardian notes. The findings have reinvigorated the debate about whether herbal supplementsâ€”which don't have to be FDA-approved like drugs before going to marketâ€”should be subject to stricter governmental oversight. Advocates for such change, however, have to fight the supplement industry and powerful advocates such as Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who sponsored the 1994 FDA law exempting herb supplements, the Times notes. A Harvard professor and supplement safety expert tells the Times that if this data is accurate, then it is an unbelievably devastating indictment of the industry."

Consumerist says its investigations jibe with those of others, and with allegations from former employees who say that, despite claims it offers top dollar, Cash4Gold often mails customers much less than 20% of the jewelry they send in.

The husband of multiple wives is seeking $730,000 for humiliation, degradation, and damage to his reputation. The cartoon appeared 2 years ago when Zuma was facing corruption charges, which were dropped. It was intended to damage his reputation and dignity, said a statement by Zuma filed in court. It indicated he was abusing the justice system in as vile, degrading and violent a way as the raping of a woman, the statement added. Attorneys for the newspaper said they were surprised a suit was filed so long after the cartoon appeared. I think the president has been badly advised, a lawyer told the Johannesburg Times. All he and his legal team are going to do is drag this case back into the public eye. The cartoonist, known as Zapiro, said: I fully stand behind my cartoon and the views expressed in it, and I will not allow the president to intimidate me. Zuma successfully sued the Guardian in London last year for libel after an article referred to him as a rapist. He was acquitted of rape charges in 2006."

When the others were gone, he struck her and tried to sexually assault her. She fled into the bush and, when she was in there, she got lost and disoriented and couldnâ€™t find her way out again, a police spokesman says. The woman, who survived by drinking river water and foraging for berries, was eventually found walking down a dirt road.

University of Central Missouri mathematician Curtis Cooper has discovered the biggest prime number yet, a 17 million-digit behemoth, as part of GIMPS. The project uses a huge network of volunteer computers as part of the search for Mersenne primes, a rare type of prime number first noted in the 17th century. The numberâ€”2 raised to the power of 57,885,161 minus 1â€”is more than 4 million digits longer than the previous record holder, which was found in 2008, LiveScience adds. So what is the giant number good for? Large primes can be used for online encryption, but mathematicians say it's mostly about the thrill of the hunt. People enjoy it for the challenge of the discovery of finding something that's never been known before, the computer scientist who created GIMPS says. Cooper also wins $3,000 for the discovery, but a bigger payday looms. The Electronic Frontier Foundation will award $150,000 to the person who finds a prime with 100 million digits; a one billion-digit find returns a $250,000 prize."

The simple, speedy theft is the biggest jewelry heist in years. Police had previously said yesterday's theft at the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel netted $53 million worth of treasureâ€”even at that level a major haul. Philippe Vique, an assistant prosecutor, said the Dubai-based organizer of the diamond show had since raised the value based on a more complete inventory. Vique described a canny, but quick and logistically simple, break-in. The suspect somehow got in through the hotel's locked French doors, which open onto Cannes' famed Croisette promenade, then held up the participants of the show with a handgun and fled on foot. The hold-up itself took about a minute, all with three private security guards, two vendors, and a manager of the sale-exhibit on hand. He took a bag containing a briefcase and a small box, and then fled by another French door on the inside, Vique said. He left on foot ... it was very fast.

Adonis Ortiz, 3, was born with short gut syndrome, meaning his intestines were outside his abdominal wall and he could not absorb nutrients, MyFox NY reports. He had his first surgery at just four hours old, and has spent each Christmas of his short life in the hospital. He was also unable to eat, and had to be fed intravenously. Doctors decided to do the rare multi-organ surgery after his liver started to fail; they gave him a new liver, pancreas, stomach, and small and large intestines, all from the same donor. (The toddler's other organs had been damaged as a result of his condition. Adonis will spend this Christmas at Miami's Ronald McDonald House, so doctors can oversee his recovery. At least he has another Christmas to celebrate, his mom tells the Miami Herald. Before the transplant surgery, everything that they always kept telling me was that he has a 50/50 chance. Nobody would ever give me any other percentage until now. So, to hear that he has like an 80% to 85% chance, itâ€™s a lot better than 50. Adonis is really strong, she adds.

Jim Loewen would like you to know that title actually belongs to our country's 15th leader, James Buchanan. After taking a moment to smack Newsweek for the cheap sensationalism of its buzzy cover, Loewen imparts a history lesson. Buchanan was gay, before, during and after his four years in the White House, he writes for Salon. And the country was well aware of it. (Not convinced? Consider this line from an 1844 letter Buchanan wrote: I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. But Loewen's intention isn't just to give you a new trivia tidbit: It's to explain why Buchanan isn't lauded as such, and what that means. Quite simply, our touching belief in progress is the problem. We must be more tolerant now than we were way back in the middle of the 19th century! Buchanan could not have been gay then, else we would not seem more tolerant now. Loewen urges us to embrace a more complex national history, one in which we all moved backward for about 50 years beginning in 1890, particularly in terms of race relations.

The process of authenticating the newly discovered picture of Billy (real name William Henry McCarty Jr. , though he also used the alias William H.

It all started after Guijarro enlarged the image he'd bought and thought he recognized Billy the Kid and his best friends, Tom O'Folliard and Charlie Bowdre. Sallie Chisum is in the picture, too, ABC30 reports, and Fox News notes that research of her writings revealed the photo was taken after Bowdre's wedding.

Eighteen of the children were bussed out by court order, based on claims of abuse or neglect, and put into temporary custody. State troopers are also seeking a suspect at the compound, which was founded by jailed polygamist Warren Jeffs. The actions we've taken today have nothing to do with religion or lifestyle, said a child welfare spokesman. The pure interest is in protecting children from abuse and neglect.

Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families, Zuckerberg writes in a Facebook post. At Facebook we offer our US employees up to 4 months of paid maternity or paternity leave which they can take throughout the year, he writes, calling taking leave a very personal decision. Every day things are getting a little more real for us, and we're excited to start this next stage in our lives, writes Zuckerberg, who announced earlier this week that he is donating $20 million to help America's classrooms get faster Internet. The four months of parental leave available at Facebook is more than the 12 weeks offered to Microsoft workers, although Google employees get 18 weeks and workers at Netflix can take up to a year off, CNET reports.

The 35-year-old Army Special Forces veteran and former Green Beret was shot dead by his 4-year-old, who police say found an unsecured gun in the living room of the home in Prescott Valley, Ariz. A neighbor tells ABC15 that the homeowner was also a vet and that Thomas had formerly lived in the home, but moved out in the fall after learning his girlfriend was pregnant; that child is now 2 months old. Police believe the homeowner wasn't expecting the visit, which may explain why the gun was present. A police department rep says the investigation into the accident will continue this week, with police looking to determine how much time passed between their arrival and the shooting. Once they establish how long the homeowner may have had to deal with the gun, prosecutors will decide whether to charge him with criminal negligence, reports the Arizona Republic. According to the neighbor, it wasn't very long: Apparently when Justin and his little boy showed up, within minutes, the little boy found the gun and said, 'hey, daddy, what's this?' and it went off, he tells AZFamily.com."

According to a Michigan Court of Appeals ruling last week, Pellow's boyfriend, Khek Chanthalavong, was using a blowtorch to burn fur off a squirrel he planned to eat when he left the blowtorch unattended on Pellow's wooden deck for 15 minutes in October 2012, reports WZZM. He returned to find a fire that ripped through Pellow's apartment building in Holland Township, damaging 32 units and destroying dozens of residents' personal effects. A court initially ordered Pellow to pay $15,400 in damages. However, justices ruled last Wednesday that she may have to pay up to $2 million to cover costs paid by an insurance company, per WWMT. While the, um, barbeque was banned under Pellow's rental agreement, she argued the contract was never explained to her. The justices countered that landlords aren't required to read and explain rental agreements to tenants and found Pellow liable for the fur-burning escapade, even though Chanthalavong was the one doing the cooking.

The Washington Post reports that the red carpet was a jumble of politicians (Newt Gingrich and wife Callista) and celebrities (Streep wore Elie Saab).

Back at the White House, Obama offered more praise, saying the five have been blessings to all of us.

The woman (impregnated via rape, a friend says) demanded an abortion at eight weeks' pregnancy and said she was suicidal, but a medical panel turned her down. When she threatened the hunger strike, health authorities obtained court approval to have her baby delivered prematurely at 25 weeks. The newborn has been placed in care, the Guardian says, and officials tell the Irish Times that they've launched an internal review. It's become a test case for Ireland's new abortion law. The 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act allows for abortions in certain casesâ€”like a suicidal woman impregnated by rape or incest, or a woman's life being at riskâ€”despite a constitutional amendment that protects fetuses from inception. Now critics say the law is pointless, because suicidal women will struggle to persuade a panel of up to seven experts.

Florida Today takes an in-depth look at the original crime (a 21-year-old Freshwaters hit and killed a man with his car in 1957), the escape (thanks to good behavior, he was allowed a transfer to a prison work farm, and he simply walked away one day), and the intervening decades, during which he went by the name William Cox, and his Florida friends knew him as a fisherman and fried chicken fan they called Grandpa Bill. He was actually caught in 1975 in West Virginia, but the governor at the time wouldn't send him to Ohio to face charges, and he continued living under his fake name. A cold case unit of the US Marshals finally tracked him down in Florida, and his story came to an end when a local sheriff's deputy knocked on his trailer door and showed him a picture of himself back when he was still known as Freshwaters.

The sweatshirt, which People calls faux-vintage, seems to be referencing the fatal 1970 shootings of four unarmed students during a Vietnam War protest. Apparently the retailer had only one to sell, and it's now sold out; the sweatshirt then appeared on eBay with a starting bid of $550, but that auction ended with no bids. According to a screenshot from BuzzFeed, Urban Outfitters seemed to be hawking the $129 sweatshirt as an actual vintage piece; the description included the line, Vintage Finds are handpicked vintage pieces from allover [sic] the map, though the description didn't appear to say anything about blood, real or fake. Kent State condemned the retailer's move, Fox News reports, saying in a statement: We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit. This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today. Urban Outfitters then apologized in a statement, in which the retailer claimed to have removed the shirt from its website, as opposed to having actually sold the shirt. It was never our intention to allude to the tragic events that took place at Kent State in 1970 and we are extremely saddened that this item was perceived as such, the statement reads. The one-of-a-kind item was purchased as part of our sun-faded vintage collection. There is no blood on this shirt nor has this item been altered in any way. The red stains are discoloration from the original shade of the shirt and the holes are from natural wear and fray.

Keelin O'Neill, who inherited the stamp several years ago from his grandfather, turned it over at the World Stamp Show in New York to the American Philatelic Research Library and collected a $50,000 reward in the process. But the mystery surrounding the Inverted Jenny remains: Who stole it and three other such stamps at a 1955 convention in Virginia? Two of the other stamps were recovered years ago, and the fourth remains missing. I had no idea about the history and importance of the stamp until very recently, says O'Neill. I have to say, it's quite fascinating, and I'm excited to learn more. A hundred Inverted Jenny stamps were printed in 1918, until someone noticed the error. The misprint comes from a design that marked the launch of US airmail, featuring a Curtiss JN-4H biplane, nicknamed the Jenny. A wealthy collector, Ethel B. Stewart McCoy, bought a four-stamp block in 1936 and allowed the American Philatelic Society to exhibit them at the 1955 collectors' convention in Norfolk, Va. The stamps disappeared from a display case there, and it's been a whodunit ever since. Two were recovered in 1977 and 1982 from Chicago connoisseurs who had bought them.

All those attacks used 11.43-caliber bullets, according to the AP, and a judicial source tells Sky News that the same gun was used. The gunman opened fire on a spot where children are picked up for school, and the city is on lockdown as police hunt for the shooter, who escaped on the scooter. This is a medieval city with narrow winding roads, where it is easy for a scooter to outrun a police car, said one observer.

He admitted in court that he was trying to reach her to receive compensation or a thank you for work he did on their apartment: It was stupid, he said yesterday, RFI reports. At the time my logic was that until she returns the money, she pays back for work I carried in our apartment, or at least says thank you, I would not stop the calls. Indeed, he kept up the harassment until she finally expressed her thanks in a meeting organized by a mediator. Before then, she'd tried blocking his calls, but he just called her parents instead, according to the woman's lawyer. The 32-year-old ex apparently received an average of 73 calls per day, including 100 during the hour-and-a-half she spent filing charges against him. She suffered a lot, says her lawyer, but has since enjoyed a fantastic summer time, with no phone calls, and hopes it will last.

America's No. 2 radio broadcaster intends to give Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity the boot by year-end, per an industry source. Money is apparently the root of this problem: Cumulus Media's move is said to be the result of an impasse it reached with Premiere Networks over the cost of distribution rights, with the latter refusing to drop that cost to a number Cumulus is happy with; Premiere is the Clear Channel arm that syndicates Limbaugh and Hannity's shows. What does that mean for Limbaugh and Hannity, who have the No. 1 and No. 2 radio talk shows in America by a landslide? Not much, maybe. They'd be wiped from more than 40 major-market Cumulus channels, but they'd likely shift to Clear Channel stations in those markets. And, writing for The Week, Peter Weber thinks Limbaugh and Hannity have the upper hand, because if they do move to Clear Channel, it can't really pay them anything less than it was demanding of Cumulus.

He took the keys to a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle later found in Blacksburg, home to Virginia Tech, about 10 miles away. Ashley, a part-time business student at Radford University, was described by those who knew him as a typical college student, though he could be quiet and standoffish. He liked to run down the hallways and recently shaved his head, a neighbor said. Police said he walked up to officer Deriek W. Crouse on Thursday and shot him to death as the patrolman sat in his unmarked cruiser in the midst of a traffic stop. Ashley was not involved in the stop and did not know the driver, police said."
TEST_1_411,"(Sep 22, 2009 6:28 AM CDT) The airline industry is pledging to cut carbon emissions by 50% in 2050, reports the Guardian, in a reluctant concession meant to stave off more dramatic actionâ€”but one that will likely increase fares and trigger a race for new, greener technology. The plan will be presented at the UNÂ today and will be on the agenda at the critical climate change summit in Copenhagen this December. Beyond the emissions promise, the airlines are pledging 100% carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and entry into a global carbon trading scheme by next year. The aviation industry was exempted from carbon caps at the 1997 Kyoto conference, and today's plans are being seen as an attempt to avoid rebukes from environmental campaigners in Copenhagen. Willie Walsh, the British Airways CEOÂ making today's announcement, called the proposals the most environmentally effective and practical means of reducing aviation's carbon impact. But the director of Greenpeace was underwhelmed by its reliance on carbon trading, saying the industry was not really taking the issue of climate change seriously."

Why are the Girl Scouts willing to break their own safety rules to accommodate transgender boys? a girl who calls herself Taylor asks on a YouTube video. I think it's because the Girl Scouts care more about promoting the desires of a small handful of people than it does my safety, adds the teen, who wears a scout sash in the film. The video was posted to honestgirlscouts.com, a group that supports the Girl Scouts returning to traditional values. A spokeswoman for the Girls Scouts defended the organization's decision to allow transgender members. For 100 years, Girl Scouts has prided itself on being an inclusive organization serving girls from all walks of life, she told the New York Daily News. We handle cases involving transgender children on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on ensuring the welfare and best interests of the child in question and the other girls in the troop as our highest priority."

The film includes testimony from six high-level whistleblowers, as Fox News calls them, all of whom were on the original investigation team. They say it was actually one or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft that caused the 1996 crash, according to a statement from the producers, who explained the six waited until after retirement to reveal how the official conclusion by the (NTSB) was falsified and lay out their case. The whistleblowers do not go so far as to claim the plane was shot down (one popular theory is that it was hit by a terrorist missile), nor do they theorize about the source of the ordinance explosion, Fox News reports. But they intend to petition the NTSB to reopen its investigation. Witnesses who saw the Boeing 747 explode and crash into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island claimed to have seen a streak of light and a fireball, CNN reports. Investigators, however, said that was likely just burning fuel coming out of the plane's wing tank. TWA Flight 800 premieres on the 17th anniversary of the crash, July 17, on cable network EPIX TV."

Larry Summers was a prized marquee consultant who met with clients regularly, and eagerly used his clout to help Shaw make billions, reports the New York Times. But that lucrative relationship is now casting a shadow over Summers' work attempting to revive the economy. Summers presents his hedge fund stint as merely part-time work, and says the Wall Street insight he gained is helping shape strategy to revive the financial industry. But critics say Summers' ties raise questions about whether the government economic overhaul he's engineering will benefit Wall Street companies at taxpayer expense. This is what might be called contamination. Did Summers spend so much time with the hedge fund or investors that he started to think like them? asks a public policy professor."

On its Facebook page, the Lort Smith Animal Hospital explains how Dr. Tristan Rich knocked George out by putting him in a bucket of anesthetic-laced water, removed the tumor, and then sealed the wound with sutures and tissue glue. The 10-year-old fish is now swimming around again and could live for another 20 years, the animal hospital says. The fish's owner was quite attached to the pet and decided to pay $200 for the surgery instead of having him put to sleep after he was starting to really suffer from the tumor and couldn't swim or eat properly, the vet tells the Sydney Morning Herald. The vet adds that the main cost was the anesthetic and the procedure would have cost about the same for a dog or cat. He says he has only performed goldfish surgery around 10 times in his career, but every day I'll do something different like thisâ€”operate on a little frog, or treat budgies, lizards, snakes, and wildlife.

In 2000 our presidential election came down to one state where the brother of one of the men running for president was governor of the state. So we have our problems, too. State Department officials stood by Clinton's comments, saying that she made the comparison to stress that a peaceful transfer of power happened despite the dispute. Clinton held up last year's US election as an example for Nigeria, which goes to the polls in 2011.

And at least one archeologist believes he knows what it holds. Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted, Nicholas Reeves said at a news conference on Saturday. I think it is Nefertiti, and all the evidence points in that direction. The tomb of Queen Nefertiti has never definitively been found, and Reeves believes King Tut was actually buried in her tomb because his wasn't ready, with her being shunted off to a side room, according to the BBC. He came up with his theory while analyzing detailed scans of King Tut's tomb used to create a replica for tourists. He claims those scans revealed two doorways that were covered up. Infrared scans made earlier this month seemed to support Reeves' theory, showing differing heat patterns along the walls of the tomb, AFP reports. According to the BBC, Egypt's Antiquities ministry did further scans to test the theory over the past few weeks, leading to Saturday's 90% estimate. The scans are being sent to Japan for further analysis. And while experts are now fairly convinced Reeves was right about the hidden chamber, the question of whoâ€”if anyoneâ€”is inside is still being debated. The AFP reports the next step for researchers is to figure out how to get through the hidden doorways without damaging King Tut's tomb.

On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeletonâ€”with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered by accident. Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more: This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australiaâ€”albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was hereâ€”so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.

TEST_1_445,"(Nov 10, 2011 6:44 PM) He didnâ€™t spend a cent on campaigning and he wasnâ€™t even on the ballot, but 18-year-old Jeremy Minnier has been elected mayor of an Iowa town. There were 32 ballots cast in Aredaleâ€”which has all of 74 residentsâ€”and 24 of them were write-ins for Minnier, reports the Des Moines Register. He beat out the 76-year-old incumbent, who was a good sport about it. Iâ€™ve been a leader my whole life, the mayor-elect and high-schooler says. Still, a lot of people were surprised because Iâ€™m not the most outspoken person at school. That doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s not active. Heâ€™s president of the local chapter of FFA and heâ€™s in the band. Minnier is beginning a four-year term as mayor; he plans to study landscaping and stay in the region. Minnierâ€™s family is fast becoming a political dynasty: His father was mayor and his brother-in-law has just been elected mayor of a nearby town.

TEST_1_446,"(Mar 18, 2015 11:39 PM CDT) A laboratory manager for the British Antarctic Survey is going to be remembered not for his scientific achievements, but as the world's southernmost pedophile. Police in Britain say Simon Rouen, 36, exchanged emails with undercover officers in the UK while working at an Antarctic research station and expressed a desire to abuse an 8-year-old girl, ITV reports. The final email was sent while he was in Chile on his way back to the UK. He was arrested as soon as he arrived in Britain and was sentenced to three years in prison this week, reports the BBC. Police say they also found indecent images of children on his computer."
TEST_1_447,"(Nov 25, 2015 7:21 AM) A robbery a month ago at the Liquor Market in Boynton Beach, Fla., helped Ali Arezoumandifar's family convince him it was finally time to retire. The 79-year-old liquor store clerk had chased after a man in a black mask who stole $300 worth of scratch-off lottery tickets on Oct. 27 and was knocked to the ground as the perpetrator sped away. It shook up the plaza, an officer tells the Palm Beach Post. Arezoumandifar was the previous owner of the store and had stayed on after its sale to help the new owners get started, reports the Sun Sentinel. During his last shift on Sunday, family members gathered to prepare a celebratory dinner. But Arezoumandifar never showed. A customer found the man dead of a single gunshot wound behind the store's counter around 8pm. A surveillance camera failed to capture the crime, but police say Arezoumandifar was shot while behind the counter. The cash register was found empty. Police aren't saying whether Sunday's crime has any link to the October robbery. In that incident, police traced the stolen lottery tickets to a couple, who face charges over another robbery at a 7-Eleven. The man is in jail, but the woman was questioned and is considered a person of interest, police say. It's very sad, says a woman who works nearby, adding Arezoumandifar spoke little English but would kiss her hand to say hello. I'm begging of anybody who knows anything to come forward, Arezoumandifar's daughter tells WPBF. He didn't deserve the way he died. (Another case of tragic timing, this time involving a wedding.)"
TEST_1_448,"(Nov 7, 2014 12:21 PM) Police in California say they've solved a 4-year-old case involving the murder of a couple and their two young children. They arrested Charles Chase Merritt, 57, described as a former business partner of Joseph McStay, reports the Los Angeles Times. McStay, 40, disappeared in 2010 along with his wife, Summer, 43, and sons Gianni, 4 and Joey Jr., 3. Their bodies were found last year in shallow graves in the desert in San Bernardino County. I don't need to tell you this is a cold and callous murder on an entire family, says the local district attorney. Police haven't yet elaborated about a motive. It's not clear how well the two men knew each other, or what their business ties were. The San Diego Union-Tribune says only that McStay worked for a water-feature business, while the Times says he and Merritt ran a fountain-making business that by all accounts was doing well."
TEST_1_449,"(Nov 27, 2015 6:00 PM) Where's the beef? That's what authorities would like to know after someone stole 40,000 pounds of it from a meat plant in central Pennsylvania. State police say it happened last Saturday at Nicholas Meat near Loganton. According to troopers, a trucker loaded $110,000 worth of meat into a trailer during a scheduled pickup and drove off. He was supposed to deliver it by Monday to a company in Milwaukeeâ€”but never showed up. A spokesperson for Nicholas Meat says the customer notified him Tuesday about the missing product, which would have been enough to make 160,000 burgers. Police later discovered the driver used a fake ID to get the delivery contract. Authorities say the company information on the truck was also fraudulent. The investigation continues."
