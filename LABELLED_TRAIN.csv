The final choice whether to allow virtual caucuses in Iowa and Nevada is up to the party's powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee. But opposition from DNC's executive and staff leadership makes it highly unlikely the committee would keep the virtual caucuses, leaving two key early voting states and the national party a short time to fashion an alternative before the February caucuses. The state parties had planned to allow some voters to cast caucus votes over the telephone in February 2020 instead of showing up at traditional caucus meetings.",DNC Is Nervous About 2 Virtual Caucuses
TRAIN_1_2,"(Sep 14, 2016 8:24 AM CDT) Authorities have finally made arrests in the death of two girls in California more than 40 years later. Police say 65-year-old cousins Larry Patterson and William Harbour murdered Doris Derryberry, 13, and Valerie Lane, 12, after they vanished from a shopping mall in 1973. The girls were found dead, each shot by a shotgun, beside a dirt road in Marysville hours after they were reported missing, per the AP. Doris had been sexually assaulted and semen was collected from her body. However, it was only sent for testing in March 2014 by an investigator who had a bit of free time and really looked very closely at this case, Sheriff Steve Durfor tells the AP. The semen matched DNA samples taken from Patterson and Harbour during previous arrests, police say. Pattersonâ€”convicted of rape in 1976 and wanted for failing to register as a sex offender, per Reutersâ€”was arrested Tuesday in Oklahoma. Harbour, who has felony drug convictions, was also arrested Tuesday in the girls' hometown of Olivehurst, Calif. The men were 22 at the time of the murders. After decades of suffering and grief, Durfor says the girls' families can finally have some closure. They have waited ... for 43 years for an answer as to what happened to their kids, adds a Yuba County DA.

You'll never find him, Amy Fry-Pitzen wrote of little Timmothy, whom she had taken out of kindergarten class on May 11, 2011, telling the school there was a family emergency, CNN reports. Three days later her body was found in a Rockford hotel room, and the boy, who would now be 10, hasn't been seen since. But even though all leads so far have turned up empty, Timmothy's family, including dad Jim Pitzen, still harbors hope the boy is alive, claiming that Fry-Pitzen, who suffered from depression, would never have hurt him and citing the fact that the note she left behind indicated that Timmothy was OK and with someone who would take good care of him. I have yet to meet one person who believes that she would ever harm her child, Aurora Det. Lee Catavu says in a clip from The Hunt With John Walsh, which featured Timmothy's story last night, per the Chicagoist. Missing from Fry-Pitzen's hotel room were her cellphone and Timmothy's toys, clothes, and Spider-Man backpack, the Charley Project notes. The site adds Fry-Pitzen's recovered SUV was visibly dirty, with soil and weeds stuck to the tires, suggesting the vehicle had driven in a grassy meadow. Timmothy's family is hoping renewed exposure, and a recent age-progressed photo of Timmothy as he might look now at age 10, will bring in new leads. We need people to take a few seconds to look at the image, to absorb it, and then be motivated to make the call, a rep for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children tells the Aurora Beacon-News.

But they'll all require viewers to wear 3-D glasses to get the full effect. 3-D for the naked eye is under intense development that's expected to take at least another decade. Don't expect 3-D TVs without glasses anytime soon, one expert tells Scientific American. The most promising technology is a film that projects 3-D images, which can be seen without glasses. The polymer already exists, but there are technical hurdles to making one big enough and with a fast enough refresh rate to serve as a TV. Other possibilities include a holographic display that's stuck in the R&D stage and technologies that require precise alignment of displays and light. It is hard to imagine that glasses-free displays will match glasses-based displays in terms of resolution, quality and frame rate anytime soon, says another expert.",3-D Glasses Here for the Long Haul

The once discarded Kurt Warner was steady in a 33-13 rout of the Panthers, throwing two touchdown passes, while Delhomme threw five interceptions and lost a fumble. The Cardinals were nearly 10-point underdogs, and few gave them a shot at winning on the road against dominant Carolina.

The car isn't completely independent, thoughâ€”the autopilot only works up to 70mph and doesn't function in urban areas, reports Popular Mechanics. When a human needs to take the wheel, the car lets off a warning; if there's no response, it pulls over to the shoulder and comes to a stop with flashers on.

Scottish prosecutors have sent a letter to Libyan authorities on their behalf and that of US AG Loretta Lynch requesting permission for Scottish police and the FBI to interview the unnamed suspects in Tripoli, Reuters reports. While not many details are yet available on the suspects, they're believed to have worked with Megrahi in carrying out the attack, per a Scottish Crown Office spokesman. Megrahi claimed innocence until his 2012 death from cancer, three year after he was released on compassionate grounds from a Scottish jail due to his illness, per Reuters. Last December, Scotland's head prosecutor noted that while there wasn't any new evidence to vindicate Megrahi, it had been difficult to track down any new suspects due to ongoing turmoil in Libya after the 2011 death of leader Moammar Gadhafi, the news agency notes. But even some of the Lockerbie victims' families believed Megrahi and supported him as he tried to appeal his case, which is leading to some skepticism about these two new suspects, the AP reports. Many in this country simply don't believe Megrahi was involved and that this was a miscarriage of justice, the father of one of the victims tells the BBC.

A fatberg is what is created when congealed fat and unflushable items (think sanitary napkins, diapers, wipes, the Independent notes) combine in the sewer to create, well, the stuff of nightmares, and a 1940s-era sewer in London has been broken by an 131-foot-long one weighing roughly 11 tons. The huge mass was removed after businesses in the affluent Chelsea district complained about a putrid odor, the Evening Standard reports. We see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through, but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a meter in diameter is mind-boggling, a repair and maintenance supervisor at the water company tells the Guardian. Much of the fat comes from used cooking oil, millions of liters of which are poured down drains in London each year. And the wet wipes (which some people are apparently using instead of toilet paper) come from the one in five Londoners who admit to flushing them. Iâ€™d urge people to consider what lurks beneath their feet, says the supervisor. When it comes to getting rid of fat, 'bin itâ€”donâ€™t block it.' The whole messy business, including repairs to the sewer, is expected to cost more than $600,000 and take more than two months, with work finishing in May. And yes, the Washington Post notes, the same phenomenon happens here in the USAâ€”New York City spends millions dealing with grease backupsâ€”though we don't often use the term fatberg.

Ferreyr filed a $50 million lawsuit against Soros in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday, the New York Post reports. She claims she dated Soros, who is worth $14.5 billion, for five years but they split up a year ago.

She says Soros then allegedly slapped her, tried to choke her, and tried to hit her with a glass lamp, which later cut her foot when he smashed it on the ground. At some point, Ferreyr claims, Soros promised her another apartment insteadâ€”worth $4.3 millionâ€”but again reneged. While Soros' lawyer acknowledges the pair had an on-again, off-again, and non-exclusive relationship, he calls the lawsuit frivolous and entirely without merit.

Prosecutors say Harold Henthornâ€”charged with first-degree murder in the Sept. 29, 2012, death of Toni Henthorn, 50â€”staged his wife's death to look like an accident because he stood to benefit from life insurance policies totaling $4.7 million that she didn't know existed.

Henthorn told investigators he moved his wife's body to flatter terrain so he could tend to her after the fall. Investigators previously said they suspected Henthorn of removing the diamond from his wife's ring, in part because her hand was not badly injured in the fall.

The Pentagon chief expressed his regrets at a Pentagon briefing yesterday and said he is open to alternatives, but gave no hint that he would stop the weekend trips. For 40 years that Iâ€™ve been in this town, Iâ€™ve gone home because my wife and family are there and because, frankly, I think itâ€™s healthy to get out of Washington periodically just to get your mind straight and your perspective straight, he said. The Washington Post notes that Panetta paid for trips home himself while he served in Congress and in the Clinton administration, but as defense secretary, government rules require him to fly on military aircraft with secure communications. He is required to reimburse the government for the cost of a round-trip commercial flight each time, but that has only added up to around $17,000 while his trips have cost around $860,000, the AP notes. The issue is a bit contentious, considering the budget concerns the Pentagon is dealing with, but Panetta often makes stops for official business on his way to or from Californiaâ€”and works while he's there, too.",Panetta Feels Bad About $800K in Flights He's Taken

The dead in today's suicide bombing included at least three police; 51 people were reported wounded. The militant onslaught has killed at least 80 in the past two weeks.

About half of the babies with it don't respond to the first drug that's tried, meaning doctors then use an injectable drug called Synacthen Depot, which one doctor says works 90% of the time. But Synacthen Depot is the latest drug to cause an uproar after a massive price hike, at least in Canada, CBC reports. The price of Synacthen Depot increased by more than 2,000% from $33.05 per vial to $680 per vial, says a spokesperson for Alberta Health, which delisted the drug in July. That means it won't be automatically paid for by Canada's government-subsidized health care anymore, TheStreet explains, though exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis. And as for the price, Fusion explains that the drug requires a six-week course, for a total cost of $14,280. Officials in other Canadian provinces saw a similar hike in the cost of the drug. This was just dropped like a bombshell, says a Toronto neurologist who is incensed by the price increase. Pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt owns the rights to the drug in Canada after acquiring another company last year, and a rep says the drug was losing money when the company acquired it. They just bought it and jacked up the price, says the neurologist. (When Canada tried to lower the price of another drug, it got sued by a US company.)","Latest 2,000% Drug Price Hike Hurts Infants"

At the time, the Massachusetts man's member was only an inch long following a partial penectomy he had to undergo due to penile cancer. His urologic oncologist, Dr. Adam Feldman, thought the idea was outlandish, as the New York Times puts it. But then three years later, Manning got a call from Feldman: Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston was ready to try the operation. And so over May 8 and 9, 64-year-old Manning received a new penis from a deceased donor, in what was only the third such operation in the worldâ€”and, potentially, only the second to be successful. So far, Dr. Curtis Cetrulo, who led the surgical team through the 15-hour procedure along with Dr. Dicken Ko, is cautiously optimistic, a sentiment backed up by Manning's own admission that he has felt little pain over the last week and experienced only one complication, some hemorrhaging early on. He has been forced for years to sit to urinate, and his doctors say within a few weeks he should once again achieve normal urination; restored sexual function will follow.

The FAA said yesterday it hopes to return the facility to full service by Oct. 13 and that crews are working to install replacement equipment. Authorities say a contract employee started a fire Friday at the regional control center in suburban Aurora and then attempted to commit suicide. More than 2,000 flights were canceled that day at O'Hare and Midway international airports, disrupting travel nationwide. About 600 flights were canceled at the airports yesterday, and delays were about a half-hour.

Agents served search and arrest warrants on homes, warehouses, and smoke shops in at least 25 states this morning, a DEA spokesman said. The largest single operation is a state-wide effort in Alabama. Agents also are serving warrants in Florida and New Mexico, among other states. The crackdown involves 33 DEA cases, and seven Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations. The DEA has been cracking down on synthetic drugs, including so-called bath salts, spice, and Molly, since the drugs first gained widespread popularity years ago. In late 2010, the agency responsible for enforcing federal drug laws moved to ban five chemicals used to make synthetic marijuana blends, including K2, Spice, and Blaze. An interesting aside involves the money trail: Investigators have tracked hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds being sent to Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, says a rep for the DEA Special Operations Division.

You have the power to end this, he says. You have the opportunity to put this all to rest. The siblings from Rexburg, Idaho, have not been seen since September and police say they have information that Lori knows either the location of the children or what has happened to them. Vallow and her new husband, doomsday writer Chad Daybell, abruptly left town the day after police attempted to do a welfare check on Joshua at the request of a relative. Investigators including local police and FBI agents searched Daybell's home on Friday, reports the AP. Police have said they believe the children's lives are in dangerâ€”and they suspect the couple's disappearance is linked to the sudden death of Daybell's former wife, Tamara Daybell, in October. He married Vallow a couple of weeks later. Authorities, who initially believed Tamara Daybell's death was natural, have exhumed her body. Vallow's previous husband, Charles Vallow, who had initiated divorce proceedings, was shot dead by her brother in August; her brother died from unknown causes last month. In divorce papers filed in February, Charles Vallow said his wife had told him she was a god assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ's second coming in July 2020, and she would kill him if he got in her way.",Son With 2 Missing Siblings Makes Emotional Plea to Mom

Greenglassâ€”who admitted decades later that he lied on the stand about his own sisterâ€”died in New York City on July 1, according to the Rosenbergs' sons. After his release from prison in 1960, Greenglass lived under an assumed name in Queens. The Rosenbergs were convicted in 1951 of conspiring to steal secrets about the atomic bomb for the Soviet Union and were executed at New York's Sing Sing prison, insisting to the very end that they were innocent. Greenglass, indicted as a co-conspirator, testified that he had given the Rosenbergs data obtained through his wartime job as an Army machinist at Los Alamos, headquarters of the project to build the atomic bomb. He told of seeing his sister transcribing the information on a typewriter at the Rosenbergs' New York apartment in 1945. That testimony proved crucial in convicting Ethel and her husband. In 2001, Greenglass was quoted in the book The Brother by New York Times reporter Sam Roberts as saying he had not actually seen Ethel typing and knew of it only from his wife. For the prosecution, however, the typewriter was as good as a smoking gun, Roberts wrote.

Those who were uninsured in 2014 may face a tax penalty of either 1% of income or a flat fee of $95 per adult, $47.50 per child under the age of 18 (whichever fee is higher). And anyone who misses the end of the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment on Feb. 15 will be ponying up even greater penalties for 2015: the higher of either 2% of income or $325 per adult, $162.50 for kids under 18. Beyond that, the 2016 penalty will be assessed at 2.5% of income or $695 per person, adjusting every year after that for inflation. Because many people don't think about taxes until the W-2s start trickling in (often at the end of January), there won't be a lot of time for them to consider buying health insurance, NPR notes.

Not one Democrat said yes to the plan, the New York Times reports. The GOP plan for purging deficits by 2025 without raising taxes: slash $5.1 trillion in social safety net and other programs.

The Senate now begins a spring recess, so come mid-April, the approved Senate budget will need to be reconciled with the House budget that passed Wednesday. The Times notes it would be the first common congressional budget in a decade.

But there was reference to an attack on police, a police official told reporters.

Another 18-year-old was arrested on weapons charges, and two other men, aged 18 and 19, were in custody and assisting police. All the arrests took place in Melbourne.

That number might not seem high in the context of the hundreds of thousands of officers who police the nation, but the AP notes that it's definitely a low figureâ€”California and New York, for example, didn't cough up records because neither state has a system to yank badges for such misconduct, while other states reported zero instances despite media reports to the contrary. It's happening probably in every law enforcement agency across the country, says the Sarasota police chief who studied the issue for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. It's so underreported and people are scared that if they call and complain about a police officer, they think every other police officer is going to be then out to get them. If underreporting and record-keeping are problematic, so, too, is a system that's often lenient on those familiar with it. It starts with the officer denying the allegationsâ€”'she's crazy,' 'she's lying,' says a counselor. And the other officers say they didn't see anything, they didn't hear anything.

The California Department of Public Health says the presumptive positive case of plague occurred in a patient who visited Yosemite, the Sierra National Forest, and surrounding areas in early August. The federal Centers for Disease Control is testing the person, whose gender and age were not released, officials say. A child fell ill with the plague after camping with his family at Yosemite's Crane Flat Campground in mid-July. After the latest case, campers have had their reservations canceled at the 304-site Tuolumne Meadows Campground so insecticide can be sprayed into rodent burrow holes, according to the California Department of Public Health. Plague is carried by squirrels, chipmunks, and other small rodents and is spread by their fleas, but health authorities say transmission between people is rare and the risk to human health at Yosemite remains low.

Such is the plan of the Future Library, which Wired describes as part working library, part conceptual art project, part investment in unborn generations of readers. Created by Scottish artist Katie Paterson in 2014, the library will ask an author to hand over a new workâ€”unread by anyone except the authorâ€”each year until 2114. Only then will a vault at Norway's Deichman Public Library open for future readers, allowing the manuscripts to be printed on paper from 1,000 spruce trees specifically planted two years ago for that reason. The authors can write about anything and in a way, it's very pure, says Mitchell, author of 2004's Cloud Atlas and the second author to submit a work after Atwood in 2015. It was a bit tough, erasing it from inside the wastepaper bin on my laptop, but in a weird way, this work is safer than all of my other books put together. Chances are, no copies of Cloud Atlas will still be around 100 years from now, he says. Sjon, an Icelandic author who will present the third work next June, acknowledges that his language, now spoken by 330,000 people, might be gone by then, too.

Most people, it seems, responded with a shrug or with annoyance that an album they didn't want suddenly showed up in their iTunes library. This is quite a comedown for a band who, just over a decade ago, could still call itself the biggest band in the world, writes Nico Lang at the Daily Dot. He recounts how U2 seems to have firmly established itself among the ranks of bands that got huge, only to become groups that no one likes â€”think Coldplay, the Dave Matthews Band, Weezer, and, of course, Nickelback. As someone who likes many U2 records and dislikes many others, their recent output isnâ€™t so much an issue of selling your soul to the man as much as deciding to be a certain type of band, one that might not please the Achtung Baby faithful, writes Lang. Take 2009's No Line on the Horizon, for example, filled with hippy-dippy lyrics about world peace that could play while you browse the aisles at Hobby Lobby. Achtung Baby may be brilliant, but that was 1991, and the band is now more about middling commercial jingles. It doesn't help that Bono continues to come off as holier-than-thou and pompous.

Johann Breyer, a native of the former Czechoslovakia, was arrested yesterday at his home by federal authorities and now faces an extradition hearing. German prosecutors say he worked as a guard at Auschwitz and Buchenwaldâ€”and more specifically that he worked in the Birkenau section of Auschwitz where prisoners were killed in gas chambers. He immigrated to the US in 1952 and worked as a tool-maker. The New York Times says this could be the last Nazi case on American soil, and both the Times and the Inquirer describe Breyer as appearing confused at times during his initial hearing. Breyer faces 158 counts of aiding and abetting the Nazis, one for each trainload of prisoners killed at Auschwitz between May and October of 1944, reports AP. Breyer, who joined the Nazis at age 17, has previously told the AP that while he worked at Auschwitz, it was not in the Birkenau section.","Philadelphia Man, 89, Held on Nazi War Crimes"

Discovered a decade ago at the decrepit Oregon State Hospital, where One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was filmed, the remains became a symbol of the state'sâ€”and the nation'sâ€”dark history of treating the mentally ill. A research effort to unearth the stories of those who moved through the hospital's halls, and to reunite the remains with surviving relatives, takes center stage today as officials dedicate a memorial to those once-forgotten patients. No one wants to be laid to rest without some kind of acknowledgement that they were here, that they contributed, that they lived, says a state official. Between 1913 and 1971, more than 5,300 people were cremated at the hospital. Hospital officials have been working for years to reunite the remains with surviving relatives. Since the urns were found by lawmakers on a tour of the hospital in 2005, 183 have been claimed. The 3,409 that remain and have been identified are listed here.

But according to his attorney, he should not be held responsible for defaulting on a $2.2 million loan because the bank should never have issued it to him in the first place. The Georgia lawmaker and Chip Rogers, his business partner/Georgia's state Senate majority leader, used the loan to purchase a motel they planned to refurbish, but the project went under. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution points to court documents filed in June, in which a lawyer for Graves and Rogers said the bank knew the pair could not repay the loan. (The politicians say they were not aware of that filing. The bank had them sign personal guarantees in order to 'have some skin in the game' presumably meaning a sense of personal obligation for the debts ... even though they clearly could not fulfill the obligation, the attorney said. Graves and Rogers were sued by the bank, but the politicians countersued, claiming the loan was improperly declared to be in default. Both claims were dismissed this week, and a spokesman for Graves says the case was fully resolved in an equitable and fair manner.

Slaves who had fought in the war submitted a petition to the New Hampshire General Assembly on Nov. 12, 1779, while the war was still being fought. They argued that the freedom being sought by colonists should be extended to them, as well, and maintained that public tyranny and slavery are alike detestable to minds conscious of the equal dignity of human nature. Their plea fell on deaf ears, Gov. Maggie Hassan said before signing the bill. It is a source of deep shame that our predecessors didn't honor this request. The original petition was found in state archives nearly 30 years ago, but supporters pushed lawmakers to pass the bill this year in part to bring attention to an African-American burial ground in downtown Portsmouth; the city is raising money to build a memorial park to commemorate the site.

That accounts for up to 25% of all such refunds. And it's no fluke: That amount is actually a marked improvement from previous years, reports the Washington Post. One of the big problems apparently is that rules surrounding the credit are so confusing that even professional tax preparers get bamboozled.

The flare-up, which also left a UN peacekeeper dead, added to the regional chaos brought on by neighboring Syria's civil war. Hezbollah indicated the attack was in retaliation for a deadly Israeli strike on its fighters inside Syria earlier this month. Rocket and artillery fire continued on both sides of the border for hours after the initial attack. The clashes recalled the beginning of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, which was sparked by a Hezbollah attack on an Israeli military vehicle along the border, and the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah, which has an arsenal of tens of thousands of missiles and rockets, is currently preoccupied with the war in neighboring Syria, where it is aiding Assad's forces. Israeli officials believe the Shiite militant group is not interested in opening a new front with Israel. Still, some analysts warned that Hezbollah would not shy away from engaging Israel in what could become an expanded conflict drawing in Syria and even Iran.

Gentle reader, meet 20-year-old Katherine Stone of Washington state, who says she would like to lose hers so that she might rebuild her family's home, which burned down uninsured in 2014. And given that family homes aren't cheap, Stone is now selling her virginity to the highest-yet-still-at-least-not-totally-terrible bidder; bids are currently north of $400,000. People say you are supposed to do it for love, Stone tells CNN. But if you think about it, I am doing it because I love my family. To do it, Stone, who says she wants to be a lawyer, enlisted the help of brothel impresario Dennis Hof, who runs seven perfectly legal establishments of ill repute in Nevada. Hof, while acknowledging that helping Stone find a paying suitor is controversial, adds that it is her choice.

It's the largest mass release of federal prisoners ever. The inmates are drug offenders whose sentences are being cut short based on a US Sentencing Commission decision last year. The commission reduced potential maximum punishments for drug offenders and made that decision retroactive. The releases announced Tuesday are just the first of what could be up to 46,000 drug offenders released early under the sentencing changes. The overwhelming majority of more than 80,000 public comments received by the commission supported the change. The Justice Department says approximately one-third of the 6,000 inmates being released are foreign citizens who will be deported, the Post reports. The rest will transition to halfway houses or house arrest then supervised release. Inmates must petition for early release, and judges will review their petitions on a case-by-case basis. So far, judges are granting about 70 early releases a week. Some of those being released early have been in prison for decades, but the average reduction is from a 10.5-year sentence to 8.5 years.

Over the centuries, the words have retained the same meaning and almost the same sound, the Washington Post reports. The team claims that's because they all come from an ancient mother tongue that was used toward the end of the last ice age, the Guardian reports. They assert that the ancient language eventually formed seven language families, which in turn formed the 700 modern languages used by more than half of the planet today. To find the ultraconserved words, linguists looked for cognatesâ€”words that have similar meanings and sounds in different languages, like father (padre, pere, pater, pitar)â€”shared by all seven of the aforementioned language families. They then translated the cognates into what they believed the cognates' ancestral words (known as proto-words) would be, then compared those.

But from 1973 to 2006, they increased by 180, thanks in large part to new technologies that allow people to work any time, anywhere.

Police say 31-year-old Jamie Gilt was accidentally shot by her 4-year-old son while driving down a road in Putnam County, reports the Chicago Tribune. The boy had apparently found a loaded .45-caliber handgun on the floor of her pickup. She was shot through the seat and the round went through her back, a police spokesman tells the Florida Times-Union. There was a booster seat in the back of the vehicle, but ... the boy was not strapped in when the deputy got to them, he says. Gilt was rushed to the hospital and the boy was turned over to family members. Gilt has had a strong pro-gun presence on social media, including the now offline Jamie Gilt for Gun Sense Facebook page, where just hours before the shooting she boasted that her 4-year-old gets jacked up to target shoot. In a press release, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office says it has been unable to interview Gilt because of her injuries. The office says the gun was legally owned, but it is a misdemeanor for a person to store or leave, on a premise under his or her control, a loaded firearm in such a manner that it is likely a child can gain access to the firearm.

If, instead of the pipeline, trains were used to transport 830,000 barrels of oil per day, the vehicles could cause six new railroad fatalities and 49 additional injuries per year, Reuters reports. Rail would also result in the spillage of some 1,200 barrels of oil per year, the official report says, compared to 500 barrels for the pipeline. The assessment comes from a federal report that found little environmental reason not to move forward with the Keystone project. The State Department will give President Obama its final recommendation later this year. But the Association of American Railroads says the report isn't fair. It factored in casualties that are predominantly those of trespassers on railroad rights of way, unrelated to the hazardous commodities being transported, the group's president says. Meanwhile, John Boehner was quite clear on his pipeline stance today, NBC News notes. Complex? You think the Keystone Pipeline is complex? he asked a questioner. It's been under study for five years.

Some states saw their highest-ever daily tolls from the pandemic Wednesday, including Florida with 216 deaths and California with 197, far above the 159 record set in California last week, per CNN. The average number of daily deaths has risen week-over-week in at least 29 states, though daily reports of new infections are down slightly from last week.

TRAIN_1_195,"(Dec 22, 2014 6:21 AM) The winter solstice officially occurred at 6:04pm EST yesterday, marking the first day of winter and the longest night of the year. But all longest nights aren't created equal, and the longest night in Earth's history likely happened in 1912. Here's why: The Earth's rotation has been slowing a little bit every year since the planet formed some 4.5 billion years ago, and we have a phenomenon known as tidal acceleration to thank. The moon's gravity pulls on our oceans, tugging the oceans that face it into a bulge (LiveScience digs into why there's a bulge on the other side, too). But as the Earth rotates, that tidal bulge is pushed to a position just ahead of the point of our planet that's directly below the moon. That causes the Earth to experience just a bit of friction from this bulge of water as it rotates, slowing it down slightly, explains Vox. And as a NASA article explains, as Earth slows, the moon is able to inch away from us. The effects of these things are so tiny it takes atomic clocks to spot them, but they're very gradually making our nights longerâ€”mostly. In the long view, we're slowing, but geological factors (like ice melting at our poles, for instance) can impact the rotational speed, and as this University of California Observatories graph shows, the length of our day has gone infinitesimally up and down over the last century, but the peakâ€”and therefore the longest night in our historyâ€”occurred in 1912. As far as the length of last night goes, it depends on where you spent it, notes the Washington Post. Washington, DC, saw about 9.5 hours of daylight yesterday, while Miami got almost 10.5, and Fairbanks, Alaska, saw less than four.

Shriver entered political life through his 1953 marriage to Eunice Kennedy after having worked for Joseph Kennedy, the family patriarch.

JFK told me that everyone in Washington seemed to think that the Peace Corps was going to be the biggest fiasco in history, Shriver once said, and it would be much easier to fire a relative than a friend.

Waters is a prominent member of the House Financial Services Committee. Waters came under scrutiny after former Treasury Department officials said she helped arrange a meeting between regulators and executives at Boston-based OneUnited Bank without mentioning her husband's financial ties to the institution. Waters defended her role in assisting minority-owned banks in the midst of the nation's financial meltdown and dismissed suggestions she used her influence to steer government aid to the bank.

The DA's office yesterday released undistributed materials related to the case, including a map of Garrido's former victims, all four of whom were also attacked in South Lake Tahoe, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Garrido's known attacks include a 1972 rape and kidnapping and three more assaults in 1976, one of which led to his conviction on kidnapping and rape charges. He served 11 years of his sentence, was paroled in 1988, and abducted Dugard three years later in South Lake Tahoe, yet he was never a suspect. The DA's office will partner with a senator to look into the mistakes made in the case, with an eye on creating new laws to make sure the situation is not repeated.

He was 75. Tiffanie Roppolo, the CFO of Prudhomme's businesses, told the AP that he died early Thursday after a brief illness. Prudhomme became prominent in the early 1980s, soon after opening K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, a French Quarter diner that served the meals of his childhood. He had no formal training, but sparked a nationwide interest in Cajun food by serving dishesâ€”gumbo, etouffee, and jambalayaâ€”that were virtually unknown outside Louisiana. The distinctly American chef became a sensation at a time when the country's top restaurants served virtually nothing but European food. Prudhomme was known for his innovations. His most famous dishes used the technique he called blackening: fish or meat covered with spices, then seared until black in a red-hot skillet. Blackened redfish became so popular that Prudhomme lamented over customers who stopped ordering the traditional Cajun dishes that he loved (and commercial fishing of redfish was restricted, else it might have gone extinct, WWL reports). Prudhomme also invented turducken, a chicken stuffed into a duck stuffed into a turkey, Eater reports. Chef Paul was known for experimenting in the kitchen, often altering recipes with different seasonings and cooking processes. He particularly liked varying blends of three peppers: black, white, and cayenne; he has his own line of spices called Chef Paul Prudhommeâ€™s Magic Seasoning Blends. Prudhomme's bearded face and oversized frame became familiar on television talk shows in the 1980s, where he encouraged Americans to spice up their meals; he also published bestselling cookbooks.

Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. NASA puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100â€”if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris.

That's what the Calorie Control Council says, but Tara Parker-Pope at the New York Times was skeptical. So she cooked up a highly indulgent Thanksgiving meal, including 6 ounces of turkey with crispy skin (299 calories), sausage stuffing (310), and a well-buttered dinner roll (310). Then came a fattening sweet-potato casserole (300), mashed with gravy and butter (140), and a few greens and cranberry sauce (208). Dessert was killer, naturally, with pumpkin pie (316), pecan pie (503), and whipped cream (100). But that came to just 2,486 calories. Sure, wine and a hefty breakfast could fill in the rest, but stomach size and nausea would make that a toughy. So the 4,500-count may well be an exaggeration that diet food companies would like us to believe, writes Parker-Pope. But make no mistake: Your heart and gall bladder will still suffer from indulgent eating. Click for Parker-Pope's full blog.","Thanksgiving Day: Really 4,500 Calories?"

Guitarist John Berry died at a Danvers, Mass., hospice Thursday, his stepmother, Louise Berry, tells the AP, noting that he had suffered from frontal lobe dementia that had been intensifying in the months before his death. Per his dad, John Berry III, Berry helped found the group in the early '80s with Mike Diamond when they were both students at NYC's Walden School, joined afterward by Adam MCA Yauch and Kate Schellenbach. The group's first 7-inch EP was Polly Wog Stew, and Berry left the band shortly after its release; his departure was followed by Schellenbach's, and Adam Ad-Rock Horowitz came in to replace the two of them, per Billboard. Berry's dad tells the AP that as the band started hitting the big time, his son simply wasn't up for that rigor, which prompted his decision to leave. Billboard relays part of the Beasties' 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, written by Yauch, in which it was revealed how Berry's dad would often burst into their early jam sessions, held in his loft, exclaiming, Will you turn that f---ing s--- off already?! In that same speech, Yauch acknowledged Berry's contributions to the band. Other bands Berry played in after his Beastie days included Even Worse and Big Fat Love.

It was completely because of the drugsâ€”he had consumed so much of it. Kim Goodman is referring to the edible marijuana her son ate before his suicide. He and a cousin bought pot-infused candy from a legal shop Saturday, and the cousin says Goodman quickly put down four 10mg chewsâ€”and soon a fifth when he felt no effects. Then things changed. He would make eye contact with us but didnâ€™t see us, didnâ€™t recognize our presence almost, says Caleb Fowler. He had never got close to this point, I had never seen him like this. Goodman's mother says her son likely didn't see a warning on the package that the drug's effects might be delayed for a few hours. He refused to leave the rental condo later when the family went out that night, then shot himself with a gun brought along for protection. He died Tuesday. The coroner agrees the death is suicide and is awaiting toxicology reports before weighing in on whether marijuana might have contributed. If the link is confirmed, it would be the second time since legalization in 2014 that a person committed suicide after consuming edible marijuana, notes the Denver Post.

Unearthed documents show how one of the most controversial figures in American medical history, Walter Freemanâ€”who made the ice-pick-through-the-eye, transorbital method famous and used lobotomies to treat practically everything from delinquency to a pain in the neck, one VA memo notesâ€”swayed the organization in favor of the procedure, despite the fact that only a third of patients were able to lead a productive life afterward. After doctors saw Freeman perform a lobotomy in 1943, a VA report recommended the surgery be performed on veterans suffering from mental illnesses. The memo, which noted a lobotomy does not demand a high degree of surgical skill, was approved. The US government went on to lobotomize some 2,000 veterans with Freeman in the lead, the WSJ notes.

Four of the blasts occurred over four hours in locations from a busy fish market to a crowded bus station, said Police Commissioner Clement Adoda. The fifth explosion from a car bomb at a military checkpoint 50 miles outside the city wounded a soldier and two members of a civilian self-defense unit. The bomber apparently wanted to reach Maiduguri. In the deadliest blast, 18 people died when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a tricycle taxi at the entrance to the bustling Baga fish market, police said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bear the hallmarks of the Boko Haram extremist group. Maiduguri is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the extremists have made it the target for many bombings since they were driven from their base there after a military state of emergency was declared in May 2013. Boko Haram has increased suicide bombings and village attacks in recent weeks as forces from Nigeria and Chad have driven the insurgents from a score of towns along Nigeria's border with Cameroon.","5 Separate Suicide Attacks Kill 54, Injure 143 in Nigeria"

But the furious pace of layoffs eased, with employers cutting 345,000 jobs, the fewest since September. If laid off workers who have given up looking for new jobs or have settled for part-time work are included, the unemployment rate would have been 16.4%, the highest on record dating to 1994. The Labor Department also says a total of 14.5 million people were unemployed in May. Job cuts were smaller than the 520,000 economists expected, while the unemployment rate was higher than the 9.2% forecast.

Almost all of the freed prisoners are in poor health and bore signs of abuse and neglect. Three were young children. The former captives were being questioned and receiving medical treatment today in the town of Alton Kupri. Gen. Shirko Fatih, commander of Kurdish peshmerga forces in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said it appears the militants released the prisoners because they were too much of a burden. It probably became too expensive to feed them and care for them, he said. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when the Islamic State group captured the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar, near the Syrian border. But hundreds were taken captive by the group, with some Yazidi women forced into slavery. The militants transported the captives from the northern town of Tal Afar and dropped them off yesterday at the Khazer Bridge, near the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.

In that case, 3-year-old Hayden Nelson was allegedly left in a car outside Abundant Life Church for several hours by a family friend. Police explain the timeline, via the Arizona Republic: The child, mother Tiffani Nelson, and an 8-year-old sister spent the night at Courtney Arnold's home. Arnold and Nelson both had choir practice to attend; because Nelson had to get there early, Arnold, 27, agreed to bring her own daughter, along with Nelson's kids, later. AZFamily.com reports that Arnold arrived around 11am. In an emailed statement, police say indications are the suspect was a bit late and she and the other children exited the car. The suspect went immediately into the church for practice. Hayden was somehow left behind and spent three hours in the vehicle before his mother and churchmembers began searching for him. Outside temps at the time were as high as 96 degrees. The boy had stopped breathing, and died Sunday in the hospital.

Just 182 species lock up more than half of the carbon stored in the vast forest, a study published in the journal Nature Communications finds. An earlier study found that 227 hyperdominant species make up more than half the Amazon's 390 billion or so trees, the BBC notes, but the top carbon-storers include some especially big and long-lived species, as well as the most common ones, Scientific American reports. The Brazil nut tree, which can grow to be more than 100 feet tall, played a major role in carbon uptake despite its rank as only the 243rd most common species, Scientific American notes. So could the world deal with its greenhouse gas problem by simply planting huge numbers of the most carbon-hungry trees? Not a great idea, a study co-author says.

The end result was four injuries (one American, one Aussie, one Brit, and one native of Pamplona, for those keeping score at home), but mercifully zero of those were gored, reports the AP. It's tremendous how many people there are here today, said Pamplona's mayor of crowds that were swelled because the run fell on a weekend.

TRAIN_1_361,"(Aug 17, 2008 3:46 PM CDT) Two decades after its founding, al-Qaeda's golden years are over, argues Peter Bergen in the Washington Post. Osama bin Laden's plan has largely backfired: 9/11 neither resulted in US withdrawal from the Middle East, or in the defeat of impious Middle Eastern regimes. But while al-Qaeda discredited itself in Iraq and jihadists are less centralized than in 2001, the organization still poses a threat to the West. Most alarming is al-Qaeda Central's hold on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and the number of Muslim foreigners who have been traveling there. And while European Islamists are seldom linked to al-Qaeda, disenfranchised immigrants remain fertile ground for new recruits. Plus, bin Laden is still on the loose, effectively raising calls to arms in the media. The legacy will endure, even after al-Qaeda is defeated, writes Bergen.","At 20, al-Qaeda Is in Decline"

The trophy and a Simpson jersey were stolen in a burglary at Heritage Hall, home to USC's athletic department, on July 28, 1994. At the time, Simpson was awaiting trial for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, who were killed the previous month. He was ultimately acquitted in 1995.

Police would give no further details on where or how they found the trophy, saying the investigation was still open.

When to this is added the huge and brazen nature of Rajaratnam's insider trading scheme, which, even by his own estimate, netted tens of millions of dollars and continued for years, this case cries out for the kind of civil penalty that will deprive this defendant of a material part of his fortune, the judge said.",Galleon Founder Slapped With $92.8M Civil Penalty

Bradley William Stone, a 35-year-old former Marine reservist who spent a few months in Iraq and is said to have PTSD, is suspected of killing his ex-wife and five of his former in-laws, CNN reports. The first 911 call came in around 4:30am yesterday, and police found Stone's former mother-in-law and former grandmother-in-law dead in a house in Lansdale. Shortly thereafter, a neighbor of Stone's ex-wife, Nicole, also called 911; police found Nicole Stone, 33, dead at an apartment in Lower Salford. The couple's two daughters, believed to be around 8 and 5 years old, lived with Nicole Stone, but they were unharmed; Stone dropped them off with one of his neighbors in Pennsburg around 5:30am. The Stones divorced in 2009 and were said to be in a bitter custody dispute. Around 8am, police found Nicole Stone's sister, her husband, and their 14-year-old daughter dead in their home in Souderton; their 17-year-old son was wounded and is being treated in a Philadelphia hospital. Before the teen was taken out of the house on a stretcher, SWAT teams had surrounded the home and Stone was believed to have barricaded himself inside, ABC News reports. But upon entering the home after firing a diversionary device, officers did not find Stone, NBC Philadelphia reports. A man resembling Stone and wearing fatigues attacked a man in Doylestown, in neighboring Bucks County, last night, demanding his car keys; the man had a gun and fired shots at the suspect, who was last seen running into the woods.

One day before President Obama gives a speech related to US drone strategy, attorney general Eric Holder sent a letter to Congress acknowledging that the US has killed four Americans in such strikes. That includes the highly publicized killing of US-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011. He was the only one of the four directly targeted, and Holder said the move was justified because Awlaki had plannedâ€”and was continuing to planâ€”specific attacks on the US. In particular, Holder cited the failed plot to blow up an airliner on Christmas Eve in 2009. (You can read the letter via the New York Times. The other three were Samir Khan, who was killed in the Awlaki attack; Awlaki's 16-year-old son, who was killed in a subsequent strike on another target; and Jude Kennan Mohammad, a native of Florida who later lived in North Carolina.

With marginal rates down, Laffer thinks both the demand for and the supply of labor and capital will increase. Output will soar, as will jobs. Tax revenues will ultimately increase, thanks to all that economic growth.

Other sections of Washington could see even moreâ€”and as much as 3.5 feet could hit the Cascades. In Portland, where the average annual snowfall is 2.4 inches, up to 8 inches of snow are expected. One meteorologist predicts it will be the biggest snowstorm in years, and another warns of very adverse, hazardous winter conditions. Mountain driving has already turned dangerous, and other travel could become dangerous or impossible, says another meteorologist. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer notes that conditions are similar to a highly destructive 1996 storm that caused landslides when the snow turned to rain, as this snow may do tomorrow or Thursday.

The dispatcher stopped short of giving McKinley permission, but said, You have to do what you have to do to protect your baby. After 21 minutes, 24-year-old Justin Shane Martin made it inside, brandishing a 12-inch hunting knife, and McKinley promptly shot and killed him. She will not be charged since she was acting in self-defense, prosecutors say, but Martin's alleged accompliceâ€”who fled after hearing the gunshot and later turned himself inâ€”does face a first-degree murder charge. The two men were high on prescription painkillers and police say they may have been looking for more in McKinley's home, because they knew her husband had recently died from lung cancer. However, NewsOK paints an even more disturbing picture, noting that McKinley feared she was being watched for weeks, that someone may even have been entering her home, and that her dogs may have been poisoned in the days after her husband entered the hospital. She'd had previous run-ins with Martin: Her mother says he had followed her at a rodeo two years ago, and she had also run into him at a convenience store recently, CBS News reports.

The hackers were charged in indictments unsealed and announced at a Justice Department news conference in Washington, reports the AP.

That figure has now plummeted to just below half, and analysts are worried about the breakdown of what the Los Angeles Times calls a pillar of the US economy. A Pew Research Center report released Wednesday culled data from the Census Bureau, Labor Department, and Federal Reserve to determine that 120.8 American adults are in middle-class households, while 121.3 million are in the lower- or upper-class tiers. Pew defined middle class as any household making two-thirds to twice the overall median income; for a family of three, that range is $42,000 to $126,000. What's led to what Pew calls a thinning in the middle and bulking up at the edges : more low-skilled immigrants to bolster the lower class, and more women in the workforce and increased college enrollment on the upper end. All of the tiers suffered during and after the Great Recession, but the middle class saw the financial gains it had reaped over the last quarter-century virtually wiped out: The median wealth of a middle-class household in 1983 was $95,879, a number that rose to $161,050 by 2007. But after the recession, median wealth for this group was back down to $98,000 in 2010 and remained at that number until at least 2013, the Pew report notes. A recent Gallup poll also shows that people's perceptions are in line with what the Pew report shows: In 2008, 63% of Americans identified as being part of the middle class, while the poll given this spring shows that number has dropped to 51%.

Gosnell induced labor, forced the live birth of viable babies in the sixth, seventh, eighth month of pregnancy and then killed those babies by cutting into the back of the neck with scissors and severing their spinal cord, said DA Seth Williams. Patients were subjected to squalid and barbaric conditions at Gosnell's Women's Medical Society, where he performed dozens of abortions a day, prosecutors said. He mostly worked overnight hours after his untrained staff administered drugs to induce labor during the day, they said. Bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses were scattered throughout the building, Williams said. There were jars, lining shelves, with severed feet that he kept for no medical purpose. Nine of Gosnell's employees also were charged.",Philly Abortion Doc Charged With 8 Counts of Murder

People from all over the US have joined the monthlong 2013 Python Challenge, which offers prizes including $1,000 for the longest python killed, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports. But with no hunting licenses required, some fear that native snakesâ€”and some of the participantsâ€”may be in as much danger as the pythons. Going out into the bush in Florida is a potentially dangerous thing to do, a prominent Everglades scientist says. This is very, very rough terrain. Getting stuck out there without enough water could be a life-terminating experience. But he hopes the challenge is a success, because the pythons could radically change the composition of the species that we find in the Everglades, and the Everglades have enough threats without the snakes.

Yeah, that's a bit of a problemâ€”as Amador Medina learned when police accused him of keeping five disinterred bodies at his Hartford, Conn., apartment. Medina, 32, allegedly paid someone to dig up the three adults and two children for use in the Afro-Cuban religion of Santeria, the Hartford Courant reports. According to police, Medina is a Santeria priest who arranged the bodies into shrines with candles and statues. Some bodies were taken apart while others were mostly whole, kept in trash bags with holes ripped to show the skulls. Seems they were removed earlier this year from a mausoleum in Worcester, Mass., where they'd been for around 71 years, the Republican reports. No relatives have yet been found. The age of the deceased, as well as how long they have been deceased, is relevant in how they use those remains in their medicinal value in Santeria, a Hartford police deputy tells NBC Los Angeles. But Imna Arroyo, a professor at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, tells WTNH that the Medina case casts a very negative light on Santeria. She says the religion, which blends West African and Catholic beliefs, does use chickens during ceremoniesâ€”but only Medina can explain the use of human bodies.

In a 2005 lawsuit, former Google worker Christina Elwell alleged that Armstrong fired her after medical issues with a pregnancy prevented her from traveling for a few weeks. Armstrong had promoted her to a top sales-director position and publicly praised her work, but in the month she lost two unborn children, Armstrong demoted her.

Woman's World says AOL.com first brought notice to this numismatist's dream, a 46-year-old US coin that was actually formed over a 1941 Canadian quarter. Eagle eyes will spot a faint upside-down 1941 mark on the back of the quarter, right above where the word dollar appears; a blown-up photo on the eBay page points out the hard-to-see 1941. Mike Byers, the eBay seller who's trying to dump the coin (and an expert at finding such currency flaws), reveals the backstory for this particular sample, which he has listed on eBay for $35,000. His terms of sale explain he sometimes accepts offers below list, though it depends on whether it is a unique piece, as he elsewhere asserts this coin is. It turns out the 1941-turned-1970 quarter was part of a collection containing a small group of press mistakes, originally checked out and released by the Secret Service to the state of California, which then auctioned off the entire collection. But while Country Living encourages everyone to rummage through their couch cushions and piggy banks in the hopes of finding a coin like this, the website Snopes suggests that would be a wasted effort: It confirms the odd quarter to be legit, but notes that as a proof coin, it never entered circulation. It's not clear why the quarter was struck over a Canadian one in the first place. More typical mistakes often include off-center and double-strike samplesâ€”when a planchet (the round metal disk that's struck to become a coin) doesn't eject properly and gets struck more than once.

Newsday describes overwhelming evidence regarding the child's paternity: a DNA test, as well as calls made from jail to the girl, now 13, and her family in which Rosales identified himself as the baby's father. On Tuesday, prosecutors dropped a separate murder charge against Rosales. He was charged in June 2013 with the shotgun killing of another Long Island man. The charge was dropped after federal authorities arrested someone else who took responsibility for the crime.

Then it got kind of scary, because we realized we were trapped, says a local resident who was on the bridge that day. We were standing there, and then I said to my friend, 'Dude, this bridge is moving.' But although it did sag some 7 feet from the incredible weight, there actually was little danger of the bridge collapsing, reports the San Jose Mercury News. It was probably the biggest load the bridge had ever seen, said an engineer. But it did not exceed the design load capacity of the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is designed to handle about 5,700 pounds per foot; people blanketing the bridge can add up to around 5,400 pounds per foot, but engineers say they typically over-engineer to allow for 150% of the maximum. Today is the 75th anniversary of the iconic bridge, and, despite all the engineer assurances, this time city officials are not permitting pedestrians to swarm it again.

While he was getting towels for her bleeding, she tried to drown herself in a bathtub, Crump said. Officers searched the home and found the dead boysâ€”ages 2 months old and 5 and 8 years oldâ€”in a closet. The youngest boy's body was in a case of some kind in the closet, Crump said. It was an absolutely horrific scene for the officers and the brother, he said. The mother was hospitalized in critical condition with neck and abdomen wounds, he said. She is expected to survive. She will be in the hospital for some time with some very serious self-inflicted injuries, Crump said. It's a murder investigation at this point. No identities were released.

Cyanide poisoning is rare, killing just seven people in the US in 2012â€”which is why it's especially strange that five days after Ferrante's conviction, another doctor at the hospital where Klein worked also died of cyanide poisoning. Nicole Kotchey, 35, was found unconscious near her desk at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on the morning of Nov. 12 and died less than four hours later, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Now, investigators are trying to determine whether her death was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident, the Guardian reports. To have oneâ€”let alone twoâ€”is extraordinarily unusual, says the Allegheny County chief medical examiner, who adds that he doesn't know why his office would perform such an obscure test for cyanide on Kotchey, but assumes it was because of what happened to Klein. In fact, Klein's colleagues were initially stumped by her sudden and mysterious illness, which lasted three days before she died; they finally ordered everything including the kitchen sink, the medical examiner says, and the cyanide test was part of that kitchen sink. In her case, Ferrante ordered the chemical and gave it to his wife in a drink he said would help her conceive, but investigators are stumped as to what happened to Kotchey, a molecular biologist. It is possible to ingest, inhale, or absorb via skin a lethal amount of cyanide, but a molecular biology professor says people who work with cyanide are obviously very aware of its risks â€”and it's not even clear whether Kotchey did work with cyanide.

The drug didn't help, but eventually the hiccups stopped both timesâ€”until they hit a third time with a vengeance, lasting five days and causing vomiting as well. Strangely, the man was also experiencing tingling and numbness in his left arm, and doctors ordered up MRI scans of his brain and spinal cord, reports Live Science. That's when they discovered the highly unusual cause of the hiccups: a large tumor in his neck that was pressing against his phrenic nerve, they report in the journal BMJ Case Reports. The kind of tumor, a grossly orange hemangioblastoma, as IFLScience.com notes, is rare, typically benign, and slow-growing, first forming in the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord. The tumor was pressing on the roots of the nerves in the cervical spineâ€”the same nerve roots that eventually coalesce into the nerves that go to the diaphragm and trigger hiccups, says lead author Dr. Mark Goldin.

The Times notes Sacks' many contradictions: candid and guarded, gregarious and solitary, clinical and compassionate, scientific and poetic, British and almost American. He studies hallucinations later in life, notes NPR, inspired by his youthful dalliance with LSD. I'm strongly atheist by disposition, but nonetheless when this happened, I couldn't help thinking, 'That must be what the hand of God is like,' he told Terri Gross in 2012. Even as cancer consumed him, Sacks remained active, with his longtime assistant noting earlier this month that he is still writing with great clarity.

Jung Joon-young, a singer-songwriter who rose to fame on a TV talent show, and Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of the boy band FT Island, burst into tears Friday as they were sentenced to six and five years in prison, respectively, reports the New York Times. The accused perpetrated sexual crimes against multiple women, degrading women and treating them as mere tools of sexual pleasure, judge Kang Seong-soo said from Seoul Central District Court. He also said Jung filmed [the victims] nude and having sex, then spread it on a group chat, per the BBC. Police came across the videos while investigating another participant, K-pop star Seungri, charged earlier this year with supplying prostitutes to business investors. The judge said 30-year-old Choi did not feel remorse after mass-raping drunken victims in 2016. The 30-year-old Jung, who withdrew from the music industry after admitting to his actions in March, described great remorse in a final statement. I deeply regret my foolishness, he said. Both Jung and Choi are additionally required to complete 80 hours of sexual violence education and are prohibited from working with children. Still, they apparently maintain a fan base. In describing a culture of shaming victims, the BBC points to a chat-room reaction reading, This is rather too much for this type of crime.

Darshane says the BK's assistant district manager called him that night to tell him there were four or five officers asking to review the eatery's surveillance video. Darshane gave the OK, and cops holed up with the tape for nearly two hours, he saysâ€”but when they left, there was an inexplicable 86-minute gap, from 9:13pm to 10:39pm, that included when Laquan was shot, the Tribune notes.

According to a new study in Australia, parents with at least four children get the most satisfaction out of life despite the chaos and higher expenses, the Daily Signal reports. With large families, we think they have social support within the family, study lead Bronwyn Harman tells ABC News Australia. The kids are never bored, they have someone to play with and they get independence quite early on. She interviewed 950 parents over a 5-year period to evaluate their happiness level, Yahoo reports, and asked them about self-esteem, social support, and resilience. While parents with big families did have issuesâ€”like people asking if the kids had multiple fathersâ€”they were still the most satisfied. Harmon thought they'd be stressed out, but they said that they had planned a large family, it was a joyful experience for them, the house was often full of laughter, and there were many reasons to celebrate, she says. Second-happiest (by a razor-thin margin of 0.25%) were LGBT parents, who also planned their families and went the extra mile of getting kids by surrogacy, IVF, or adoption. These children are not accidents ... so the child is very much desired, says Harmon.

Not so these days, reports the Wall Street Journal: Orchids have now taken the crown from poinsettias as the No. 1 potted-plant moneymaker in the US, and you can buy them at Lowe's for $5.48. Why the change, and how? We have Taiwanese entrepreneurs to thank, and the Journal likens their approach to the energy and methods applied to making consumer electronics. The industry is based around the Phalaenopsis, or moth orchid, and dates to the 1980s, when a government-owned company switched from producing sugar to growing orchids after realizing there was more money to be had. Sugarcane fields were razed to make way for greenhouses, and an intricate orchid-production chain formed, with small groups of independent growers overseeing various steps, from producing seedlings to repackaging the flowers as they grow over 12 to 18 months. But it's actually the Netherlands that makes the most money off orchids, though Taiwan is the world leader in exports.

Military regulations used to require that executions take place at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, but that rule was amended two years ago to allow prisoners to be executed in other places. The creation of a Guantanamo Bay execution chamber would keep the men largely out of the reach of US courts, experts believe. I think that's the administration's idea, to use Guantanamo as a base to not be under the umbrella of the federal district courts, said a former Navy attorney. US officials have announced that they will seek the death penalty against the suspects. Any executions would be certain to cause international outrage, although the AP reports that US diplomats have been instructed to remind critics that Nazi war criminals were executed after the Nuremberg trials.",9/11 Executions Could Take Place in Gitmo

And steer clear of the canned stuff. University College London researchers reviewed the diets of 65,000 people; they found that those who ate more fresh fruits and vegetables tended to live longer, and the magic threshold seemed to be seven-plus servings every day. Those who hit that level reduced their risk of death from all causes by 42% as compared to those who ate less than one portion daily, the Guardian reports. More specifically, those big on fruits and veggies saw a 31% lower risk of heart disease and a 25% lower risk of cancer. Hitting five is, of course, still beneficial: Eat three to five portions, and overall risk drops 29%, while five to seven means a 36% lower risk, Time reports. In the US, the standard slogan when it comes to fruits and vegetables is more matters, but the best advice is Australia's, says a researcher; in that country, the advice is go for 2+5, or two servings of fruits and five of vegetables. From our study it looks like vegetables are better than fruit, she says. Be warned: Canned and frozen fruit, the study finds, may actually increase heart disease, stroke, and cancer risk, the Guardian notes.

The uptick in US forcesâ€”and the decision to put them closer to the front linesâ€”is designed to help Iraqi forces retake the key northern city of Mosul, and help retake Raqqa, the extremist's group self-proclaimed capital in Syria, the AP reports. Last June the Obama administration announced hundreds of troops would be deployed to help the Iraqis retake Ramadiâ€”a goal accomplished at the end of the year. Of the extra troops, most will be Army special forces, who've been used throughout the anti-ISIS campaign to advise and assist the Iraqis. The remainder will include some trainers, security forces for advisers, and maintenance teams for the Apaches. The advise-and-assist teamsâ€”made up of some dozen troops, each accompanied by security forcesâ€”will embed with Iraqi brigades and battalion, likely putting them closer to the front lines. The proximity to the battlefront will allow the US teams to provide more tactical combat advice as Iraqis move toward Mosul, still under ISIS control. Until now, US advisers have worked with the Iraqis at the headquarters level, well back from the front lines. A senior defense official told reporters that while Iraqi leaders have been reluctant to have a large number of US troops in Iraq, they also need certain capabilities that only more American or coalition forces can provide. Iraqi leaders back the addition of more US troops if their work is coordinated with Iraqis and directed toward retaking Mosul.

But it doesn't, and it's not, and scientists from Austria, the Netherlands, and Germany have combed through 88 studies with more than 8,000 participants to confirm in the journal Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews that when it comes to intelligence, brain size simply doesn't matter. Although a certain association is observable, brain volume appears to be of only little practical relevance, says Jakob Pietschnig from the Institute of Applied Psychology at the University of Vienna. The researchers write that positive associations between human intelligence and brain size have been suspected for more than 150 years. Why the long-held belief in such a link despite a lack of concrete evidence for it? It may partly be the result of publication bias, reports ScienceAlert. This means that journals more readily publish findings with strong links between subjects than weak or inconclusive links. And that's all that Pietschnig and his team found when they reviewed published and unpublished studiesâ€”a link too small to have any discernible effect. Rather, brain structure and integrity appear to be more important as a biological foundation of IQ, whilst brain size works as one of many compensatory mechanisms of cognitive functions, Pietschnig adds. This helps explain why men, who tend to have larger brains than women, do not perform better on IQ tests. To be small-minded, then, should be construed in only a metaphorical sense.

On May 23, 1967, three US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radar sites seemed to be jammed. CBS News reports it appeared to the US Air Force, which was now unable to tell if missiles were headed toward the US, that the Soviet Union was responsible. It was considered an act of war, and the Air Force prepared to launch additional planes carrying nuclear weapons. It's unclear how close the US actually came to starting a nuclear war that day, but study author Delores Knipp says, What we do know is that the aircraft did not launch. That's thanks to a handful of space weather forecasters working at NORAD, who quickly explained to the Air Force that the jamming was actually the result of a massive solar storm. Knipp tells Space it's fortunate the US invested very early on in solar and geomagnetic storm observations. The 1967 solar storm was one of the biggest of the last century. The solar flare was visible to the naked eye, and the coronal mass ejection that followed affected radio communications for days and made the northern lights visible as far south as New Mexico.

After all, doing so would mean he has churned out six books a day since the moment he was born, per Now I Know. Rather, for about 15 years Parker has owned a patent for computer software that writes books for him by employing info that's publicly available. A 2008 profile in the New York Times said he generated his collection via those algorithms, six or seven programmers, and 60 to 70 computers. Most books aren't actually printed until someone buys a copy, and there are many titles to choose from: Phys.org in late 2012 reported another 700,000 books on Amazon are listed under Parker's company, ICON Group International; it looks like nearly another 100,000 have been added since then.

She remains a polarizing figure: her enemies still regard her as nearly diabolical, while her admirers speak of her as a saint. The Telegraph looks back on her tumultuous 11-year premiership, from her surprise decision to invade the Falklands to her ignominious fall. Britain went from the sick man of Europe to a major economic power under Thatcher, who liberalized markets and crushed the power of trade unions. A close friend of Ronald Reagan and a pragmatist with Mikhail Gorbachev, Thatcher ruled unrivaled until 1990, when her own ministers engineered her downfall while she was away in Paris.

And the number of Americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: That's 83 million people, or 28% of the US population over the age of 6, reports the Wall Street Journal. We feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number weâ€™ve ever seen, says PAC member and Sports and Fitness Industry Association exec Tom Cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary Americans increased by 18% since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: The Journal notes the rise of athleisure apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8% in the year ending April 11, while performance shoes took an 18% dive. The PAC traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? The increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says Cove: There are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: Am I going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that I want to do?

Members of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are now on the ground alongside state investigators hoping to find exactly what is causing the spread of the bacteria Elizabethkingia, which has so far infected 44 people, most of them older than 65, reports the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

Six cases of the infection were initially recorded between Dec. 29, 2015, and Jan. 4, 2016, and when state health officials notified local partners the number grew and was found to date back to a case in November of 2015. Everyone affected already had serious underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems, and none are children.

These stats come from the FBI's latest crime report, though NPR notes it's important to put the figures in context: These violent crimes were still way down compared to other recent years, and especially more than 20 years ago, when figures spiked. For instance, despite its 11% increase this year, the number of murders dropped 9.3% from 2006. The number of rapes is less than in 2009, the number of robberies less than in â€¦ 2013, and assaults less than in 2010. Still quite safe, a Fordham law professor and crime expert notes on Twitter. Not that it's all smooth sailing. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the increase Monday, noting that violence tears at the fabric of our common life and that we still have so much work to do, per the Washington Post. And FBI Director James Comey said in May it doesn't make him feel better that violent crime has risen over the past year, even if it hasn't reached historic low points. In terms of last year's murders, firearms were involved in about 72% of the cases, and seven cities or regionsâ€”Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and DCâ€”accounted for much of 2015's spurt. Don't be surprised if the crime report comes up in Monday night's debate between Clinton and Trump: A Harvard Law School research fellow said Friday the stats could be turned into a political football during their faceoff, per Reuters.

To account for the gradual slowing down of the Earth's rotation, today will have 86,401 seconds instead of the usual 86,400, NASA says in a press release, explaining that the slowdown is caused by a kind of braking force caused by the gravitational tug of war between Earth, the moon, and the sun. Instead of going from 23:59:59 to 00:00:00 at midnight tonight, clocks on Coordinated Universal Timeâ€”aka atomic time â€”will go to 23:59:60 first. This is the fourth leap second this century and the first since 2012, when the extra second brought down a large chunk of the Internet. Whenever a leap second occurs, some computer systems encounter problems due to glitches in the code written to handle them, a scientist at the UK's National Physical Laboratory tells the BBC. The consequences are particularly severe in the Asia-Pacific region, where leap seconds occur during normal working hours. It's hard to predict when leap seconds will occur because so many factors, including weather patterns and changes in the Earth's core, affect our planet's rotation, according to NASA, which notes that abandoning them for a different way of accounting for the slowdown will be discussed at a conference this year.",Today Will Be the Longest Day Since 2012

The five who finished ahead of him were double amputees. Technology for prosthetics has improved so much that it is actually better to be a double amputee in track and field than a single amputee, says US sprinter David Prince, who lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident. That pace of development has accented a trend within Paralympic sports. Sometimes better technology has created a gap between athletes within the same division who have distinctly different levels of disability. Technological developments are both exciting, andâ€”to Princeâ€”somewhat concerning. He worries that some athletes, such as single amputees like himself, will be left behind. Last year and this year were really hard for me to stay motivated to actually continue training, because I go into the race knowing that [double amputees] run faster times and I know I'll get beat, he said. At the same time, he does not begrudge double amputees for availing themselves of whatever is within the rules. Instead, Prince believes it's time for single and double amputees to start competing separately, otherwise there's not going to be any unilateral amputees running because we won't have a chance.","At Paralympics, 1 Leg Isn't Always Better Than None"

Police say the jewels were lifted by eight masked men who, though armed, never fired their weapons. How did they pull it off? By cutting a hole in an airport fence then driving two vehicles through it and onto the tarmac, where they brandished their weapons and snatched the diamonds from the Switzerland-bound plane's hold. They then escaped with an estimated $50 million worth of diamonds in a process that was completed just 11 minutes after they entered the airport, reports the BBC. Der Spiegel adds that the diamonds were being transported by security company Brink's in a suitcase that weighed 22 pounds. A burned vehicle was later discovered near the airport. The theft was particularly surprising given the presumed safety of flight cargo: It costs little to insure expensive materials for flights, given that robbers can't target a plane once it's on its way and airports employ a long list of security measures. An aviation security expert called the robbery worrying, due to the lack of an immediate response.

But where a story like this may have once been a freakish anomaly, the Washington Post notes, it's now becoming increasingly and disturbingly commonplace. A Post analysis of news reports finds 23 shootings by 1-, 2-, and 3-year-olds in the US since Jan. 1 (last year at this time there were 18) and seven just since April 20. Eighteen of the toddlers ended up shooting themselves, with nine of them succumbing to their injuries. The state with the highest number of toddlers pulling the trigger since January 2015 is Georgia (eight such incidents), followed by Texas and Missouri with seven each. Snopes even fleshed out a meme in December, sourced mainly from an October 2015 Post article, that claimed more Americans were killed by toddlers than by terrorists in 2015 (the site ultimately found this assertion to be true). Correlating these shootings to factors such as population or gun-storage laws isn't so simple, the Post notes. The people-dense states of New York and California, for instance, only saw a combined three toddler shootings since January 2015, while Chicago's high gun-violence rate didn't translate into any reported incidents. The paper speculates that cultural factors may cause some areas to have higher numbers of incidents, but it concedes that at this point, figuring out what areas are more prone is still a guessing game, hampered by Congress' stymieing of gun research.

Just send in your rÃ©sumÃ©, spend an average of 15 hours interviewing, and score in the top 5% worldwide on competency tests, and maybe you'll get hired. Fortune reports the Australian app-development company re-engineered its approach after calculating that only about half its hires ended up working out. Fast Company details the current hiring process: It all begins with the company imagining an ideal hire. Then, an HR person sifts through rÃ©sumÃ©s and holds phone interviews; some 10% to 20% of applicants will be sent on to the next step. Some 70% of those people will then be cut in competency tests that require them to score in that top 5% bracket, co-founder Josiah Humphrey tells Fast Company. Next is a half-day interview, followed by an additional three-to-five-hour one. In that second meeting, one of the two interviewers spends the time examining your body language. And you might be asked to come in and do a trial workday. Of course, the team is also investigating your references behind the scenes, and the process involves about 22 hours of work for them per candidate. You start seeing glimmers of people's personalities they can't hide, things you would never be able to see in a traditional job interview, co-founder Mark McDonald told Business Insider in November. The goal, he says, is to ensure hires (50 of its 130 employees joined in the past three months) stay on for the long haul, and about 90% now do. A common thread shared by those who get the job?

The study, presented to the European Society of Cardiology, shows men and women between the ages of 40 and 79 who watch more than five hours of TV a day are twice as likely to suffer a possibly fatal pulmonary embolism from blood clots than someone who watches less than 2.5 hours of TV a day.

But that exuberance quickly turned to tears when Scott and his dad, Brian, actually opened up the box to set the game console up and found a fake wooden model inside, complete with what WHDH describes as a crude drawing and message scrawled on it. He's crying and he's upset and he's in the playroom by himself and he just wants to be alone. â€¦ I was crushed, stepmom Kristin Lundy tells WFXT. She adds in a Facebook post describing the incident: This has ruined his belief in Santa. The family took the PS4 back to the Saugus, Mass., Target where it had been purchased, and they were told this kind of thing takes place on occasion. It happens through the distribution, the assembly line or something, Brian tells WHDH. Kristin notes in her Facebook post that the same thing happened to Scott's cousin. A Target manager managed to restore the Lundys' Christmas spirit, giving them a brand-new console not made out of wood, plus a $100 gift card and an extra game. They couldn't have been any kinder, Kristin tells WFXT. The Lundys had to employ a bit of subterfuge to pull off the return, as Scott still believes in Santa: They told the boy that Santa's elves picked up the PS4 at Target because they don't do electronics at the North Pole, and that a rogue elf was responsible for the mistake, per WFXT.

Ferguson, 42, had been living with the family for two weeks when an argument erupted over his habit of smoking indoors.

Those states have articles in their constitutions requiring public officials to believe in Godâ€”in fact, in Maryland, even jurors and witnesses are technically required to believe in Godâ€”and now nonbelievers are trying to get rid of such rules, even though they are rarely invoked. If it was on the books that Jews couldnâ€™t hold public office, or that African-Americans or women couldnâ€™t vote, that would be a no-brainer.

The recipients were announced Wednesday in Stockholm by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, per the AP. There is enormous power in this genetic tool, which affects us all, Claes Gustafsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said of the CRISPR/Cas9 scissors the women discovered in 2012, per a release. It has not only revolutionized basic science, but also resulted in innovative crops and will lead to groundbreaking new medical treatments. The CRISPR scissors can be used to change the DNA of animals, plants, and microorganisms with great precision. Gustafsson said that as a result, any genome can now be edited to fix genetic damage, though he cautioned that the enormous power of this technology means we have to use it with great care. Still, it is equally clear that this is a technology, a method that will provide humankind with great opportunities. I was very emotional, Charpentier told reporters by phone from Berlin after hearing of the award, adding: My wish is that this will provide a positive message to the young girls who would like to follow the path of science, and to show them that women in science can also have an impact through the research that they are performing.

With Herman Cain out of the race, Gingrich now has the support of 33% of likely GOP voters, with Ron Paul and Mitt Romney tied for second place with 18% each, the poll found. Some 11% of those polled said they'd vote for Rick Perry, 8% for Ames straw poll winner Michele Bachmann, 7% for Rick Santorum, and 2% for Jon Huntsman. More than half of the likely caucus-goers say they might still change their mind before the Jan. 3 vote, but pollsters expect Gingrich to stay in the lead because he doesn't have the big negatives voters see in Romney and Paul. Some 45% considered Romney's health care reform in Massachusetts a reason to oppose him, and 46% cited Paul's opposition to US military intervention overseas as a major negative. For Gingrich, his views on immigration and his marital history were seen as a negative by just 15% and 16%, respectively. Donald Trump is hosting a Republican debate in Iowa the week before the vote, and so far, Gingrich is the only GOP hopeful who has confirmed that he'll take part.","Latest Iowa Poll: Newt Gingrich Clear Frontrunner, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney Tied for 2nd"

A Belgian-led team reported Monday that it's discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star less than 40 light-years away. It's the first time planets have been found around this type of starâ€”and it opens up new, rich territory in the search for extraterrestrial life. Because this star is so close and so faint, astronomers can study the atmospheres of these three temperate exoplanets and, eventually, hunt for signs of possible life. They're already making atmospheric observations, in fact, using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope will join in next week. Altogether, it's a winning combination for seeking chemical traces of life outside our solar system, says MIT researcher Julien de Wit, a co-author of the study, released by the journal Nature. The star in questionâ€”named Trappist-1 after the Belgian telescope in Chile that made the discoveryâ€”is barely the size of Jupiter and located in the constellation Aquarius. Other exoplanet searches have targeted bigger, brighter stars more like our sun, but the starlight in these cases can be so bright that it washes out the signatures of planets. By comparison, cool dwarf stars that emit infrared light, like Trappist-1, make it easier to spot potential worlds. University of Liege astronomers in Belgium built the Trappist telescope to observe 60 of the nearest ultra-cool dwarf stars and, de Wit notes, the risky effort paid off.",3 Surprise Planets Could Host ETs

That's the finding of University of Missouri researchers who broke down the types of drunks into four distinct categories in a study published in the Addiction Research & Theory journal. Scientists surveyed 187 pairs of undergraduate drinking buddies from a Midwestern university about their sober and intoxicated states. The findings: the subjects were either a Hemingway, Mary Poppins, Nutty Professor, or Mr. Hyde drunk. The largest group: the Hemingways, which represented about 42% of the subjects. These subjects reported experiencing the smallest decrease in organizational and intellectual skills and are drinkers who tend not to undergo drastic character changes or experience harms (meaning you probably won't have to worry about getting kicked out of a bar if you're a Hemingway). Per the Guardian, about 23% could be called Mr. Hydeâ€”or Ms. Hyde, since more than half of the subjects who fell into this category were womenâ€”meaning they became particularly less responsible, less intellectual, and more hostile when under the influence of alcohol. One-fifth earned the honor of being labeled the Nutty Professor, meaning they were more introverted before imbibing and became much more gregarious and uninhibited afterward. The Mary Poppinses, which made up about 15% of the pool, are particularly agreeable after drinkingâ€”in other words, the happy, sweet drunks who don't cause any trouble. So what was the point of the study, other than having names to attribute to friends while bar-hopping?

Nimoy died at home of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, his wife tells the New York Times. Nimoy discussed his struggle with the disease last year, blaming it on years of smoking, which he gave up 30 years prior. He was hospitalized for chest pains earlier this week, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Nimoy, born in Boston to Jewish parents, acted from a young age and was teaching Method acting at his studio when his casting in the original Trek in the mid-1960s catapulted him to stardom. He went on to other TV and movie roles and was also a frequent theater performer; he directed movies and TV shows, published books of photography, made records, gave spoken-word performances, and wrote poetry. But it was to Spock, with his signature Vulcan salute and Live long and prosper catchphrase, that Nimoy was most inextricably linked, and his feelings about that can be summed up in the titles of two autobiographies: 1977's I Am Not Spock and 1995's I Am Spock. He remained tied to the character, voicing him in the Star Trek animated series, directing Trek movies, writing songs about the show, and appearing in both of JJ Abrams' recent Trek reboots as an older version of Zachary Quinto's Spock. Nimoy, who served two years in the Army in the 1950s, returned to college in his 40s to earn his master's degree in Spanish and later was awarded an honorary doctorate. He is survived by his second wife, Susan Bay Nimoy, as well as two children, a stepson, six grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. And that aforementioned Vulcan salute? That was his idea, the Times notes; he based it on a Hebrew blessing. As Kotaku notes, Nimoy's last tweet, from Feb. 22, is pretty perfect : A life is like a garden.

Given their profound impact on peopleâ€™s lives, how much compensation workers get for traumatic injuries seems like it would be the product of years of study, combining medical wisdom and economic analysis, write Michael Grabell and Howard Berkes. But in reality, the amounts are often the result of political expediency, sometimes based on bargains struck decades ago.

The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office says the five officersâ€”who tackled protester Rakeem Jones instead of the man who sucker-punched him as he was led out of the Crown Coliseumâ€”have been reprimanded and placed on probationary status for a year for unsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies of the department, ABC News reports. Three of them were demoted in rank and suspended without pay for five days, while another two were suspended for three days. The actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will not ever be tolerated under the policies of this office, Sheriff Moose Butler said, per the Fayetteville Observer. He said that when deciding the punishment, his office took into account the past bravery and exemplary conduct of the deputies. John McGraw, 78, has been charged with assault and disorderly conduct for allegedly punching Jones. Earlier this week, the sheriff's office decided not to charge Trump with inciting a riot by making inflammatory statements at the March 9 rally.

The first time, she stumbled while walking and he grabbed me to steady me. But he grabbed me by the shoulder and by the crotch, Aho, 29, tells WMCT-TV. I thought that maybe it was just an accident, but then he offered me money for sexual favors, and then he grabbed my crotch again. A second attack kind of seemed opportunistic, suggesting that he'd been watching her, Aho says, while the third left her terrified, per the Daily Dot. While walking alone at night, she says she turned around to find the man following her. Aho reported each encounter to policeâ€”she says officers asked for a photo of the suspect, which she couldn't provideâ€”but she soon grew frustrated knowing her assailant was still at large. Finally, after using an online police sketch generator to create a portrait of the suspect, she posted it to Facebook. It's now been shared more than 1,200 times, including by the restaurant where Aho works. Street harassment is a real issue, her boss says. I figured we should spread the news and the picture outside our circle, and hopefully this person will get caught. An officer says the sketch has generated some calls, but it might be best if she had let us create the sketch ; it isn't clear if Aho was presented with that option. In Aho's view, it was all for the best. Countless people have offered me help in everything, from walks home to loaning me their gunsâ€”which, like, I'm not into for a number of reasons, but I appreciate the sentiment, she says.

Alexa Nicole De Armas was arrested on Friday after police caught wind of the ring; four female students at Sarasota County's Venice High reportedly told their teachers that Alexa and a male student had pushed them to join the ring. Per police documents, Alexa and a second student came up with what the Herald-Tribune terms a business plan before the school year began. Their alleged intention was to pimp out fellow teens in exchange for money and alcohol. Deals were arranged via Facebook messages, and WWSB reports the girls said Alexa used Facebook to facilitate things because she doesn't have a cell phone. Students say three deals were made, and police say at least one sex act did take place: John Michael Mosher, 21, allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old against her will after forking over $40 and a bottle of liquor; he has been arrested. Police got a search warrant for Alexa's Facebook account, and say they found communications regarding participants, how to split the money, and pricing, which apparently topped out at $100.

That's what industry sources told the Mirror, though Plant's rep quickly shot down the story. The Mirror's sources said Zep superfan Sir Richard Branson offered the band that much money to do 35 concert dates in three locations (London, Berlin, and New Jersey), but Plant refused despite Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and the son of late drummer John Bonham being on board. It was a no-brainer for [the rest of the band], but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it, one source says. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him. But Plant's publicist calls the story rubbish. Even so, earlier this year Page told the Guardian, Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. [Robert]'s just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, to be honest with you.

She called 911 three hours later when she couldn't wake the baby. It was revealed following Adam's death that Cardillo had been running the daycare without a license for 11 years. Adam had no apparent signs of trauma and hadn't been sick when he died, leading investigators to originally believe he died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, People reports. But a toxicology report found elevated levels of Benadryl in Adam's system. The FDA warns against giving the medication to children under 2 years old as there is a high risk of overdose. Fairfield police chief Gary MacNamara calls Adam's death a parent's worst nightmare. No charges have been filed, but MacNamara says that will change.

A 147-page document notes Joseph Adamec and James Hogan of the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese moved offending priests between parishes, paid off victims, and even threatened them with excommunication, per the Christian Science Monitor. One accused clergyman was moved to a school for boys, per the AP. Hogan, who led the diocese from 1966 to 1986, died in 2005; Adamec, his successor who retired in 2011, refused to testify. The report was compiled using secret diocese documents, including some found in a safe, Pennsylvania AG Kathleen Kane tells the Wall Street Journal. No charges have been laid because the statute of limitations has either run out or the alleged abusers have died. These predators desecrated a sacred trust and preyed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe, Kane says. Just as troubling is the cover-up perpetrated by clergy leaders that allowed this abuse to continue for decades. The report describes a kind of guide leaders used to determine how much money victims should be offered to keep quiet. Payments to victims of above clothing, genital fondling started at $10,000, while victims of sodomy; intercourse were paid $50,000 to $175,000, per the report. Adamec's attorney says his client deeply regrets any harm that has come to children who were victimized, but adds the claims against him are unfounded.

But it wouldn't necessarily be recognized as a flower today, given it didn't boast petals or nectar-producing structures. The fruit contains a single seed â€”thus making it an angiosperm, or flowering plantâ€” which is borne upside down, says Indiana University paleobotanist David Dilcher, who with colleagues reports these findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The plant thrived in freshwater lakes in what are now Spain's mountainous regions, and while Phys.org reports that the fossils were first discovered more than 100 years ago, the ones used in this study were poorly understood and even misinterpreted when analyzed at earlier points, Dilcher says. One way to spread seedâ€”which in angiosperms is typically done by getting other animals (think bees) or elements (think wind) to carry pollen to other members of the same speciesâ€”is through water currents. In fact today's descendants of Montsechia, called Ceratophyllum, are found in lakes on every continent, and they behave similarly. Flowers are all about sex, Dilcher tells Newsweek. Right at the start [of angiosperm evolution], this was another method that flowering plants were using for their genetic exchange. Whether Montsechia is the world's oldest flower has yet to be determined, but it is the oldest flower we have found to date, suggesting that angiosperms have their earliest roots in water instead of on land.

Both plaintiffs accuse the actor of abusing them in the 1980s when they were around 14 years old, the New York Times reports. One plaintiff is anonymous, and the other is Star Trek: Discovery cast member Anthony Rapp, who first aired his allegations against Spacey in 2017. In the lawsuit, Rapp says that after Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan home in 1986, the actor grabbed him by the buttocks, lifted him onto a bed, and laid down on top of him. Rapp says he suffered psychological injuries, severe emotional distress, humiliation, fright, anger, depression and anxiety, reports TMZ. After Rapp, the first of numerous people to accuse Spacey of sexual misconduct, came forward in 2017, Spacey said he didn't remember the incident, but apologized for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior. The other plaintiff in the lawsuit said he was a 14-year-old acting student when he met Spacey in the early 1980s. He said he engaged in sexual acts with Spacey on several occasions. In the lawsuit, he states that he fled Spacey's apartment after the actor sexually assaulted him despite him resisting and saying no.",Lawsuit Accuses Spacey of Molesting 2 Teenagers

But in six states, it's not so easy. As the New York Times explains, bases in Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and West Virginia haven't followed the Pentagon's order regarding benefits, and instead have instructed couples to travel (often long distances to) federal bases to get the ID. Their logic: The National Guard units are state agencies that have to adhere to state lawsâ€”like gay marriage bans. Says Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin: Sending gay military couples to federal bases protects the integrity of our state Constitution and sends a message to the federal government that they cannot simply ignore our laws or the will of the people.

The woman died three weeks later, and her estate filed a lawsuit against the children and their parents. The judge didn't determine liability in the caseâ€”only that the girl can be sued. There was no evidence that the girl lacked intelligence or maturity, and nothing to indicate that another child of similar age and capacity under the circumstances could not have reasonably appreciated the danger of riding a bicycle into an elderly woman, the judge wrote, citing cases from as far back as 1928. He decided that the girl's mother, who was present at the time, didn't encourage her daughter's risky behavior, and that she played no active role in the incident, the New York Times reports.

A new study finds that when women hit their 40s, their closest confidant shifts from their spouse to a woman about 25 years youngerâ€”presumably a daughter. Researchers analyzed almost 2 billion cell phone calls and 489 million texts to come to their conclusions, identifying the first and second best friends of each participant based on who he or she called and texted most often, the Los Angeles Times reports. During early adulthood, No. 1 for both men and women tended to be a same-aged member of the opposite sex, most likely a significant other. But by their 40s, women tended to shift attention to daughters, as the male moved to the No. 2 position. Meanwhile, women remained in the No. 1 position for men, with either a presumed daughter or sonâ€”no preference was shownâ€”occupying the No. 2 slot. Researchers say evolution could explain the findings: Women tend to help with grandchildren in order to ensure their genes survive, while men are able to reproduce later in life than women and thus may have more of an interest in keeping a female in the top spot.","For Older Women, Daughter â€”Not Husbandâ€”Is No. 1"

The company made the announcement in a blog post, noting the $827,659.49 will be split evenly, so each charity will receive $82,765.95. Now here's the fun part: Reddit users will help choose which charities get a check. The rules are designed to reduce any potential shenanigans : Anyone with a Reddit account before 10am PST yesterday (the announcement came at 10:01) can vote a single time per charity, but for as many charities as he or she would like. Redditors can look up charities via the Charity Navigator database then vote on Reddit's donate page. Voting wraps up Wednesday. Mashable points out Reddit's $8.3 million in ad revenue is rather measly compared to BuzzFeed's earnings; that site passed the $100 million mark in 2014. (Per similarwb.com, Reddit gets more traffic than Buzzfeed.) The discrepancy is probably due, at least in part, to Reddit's tiny banner ads. Electronic Frontier Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, NPR, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Internet Archive were the most discussed charities on Reddit yesterday, CNNMoney reported, and they remain that way today.

TRAIN_1_936,"(Dec 8, 2020 10:20 AM) Axios is out Tuesday with the results of a yearlong investigation that makes some big claims about Chinese espionage tactics. The story by Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian focuses on a young woman identified as Christine Fang, or Fang Fang, who established herself as a presence in Bay Area politics, first as a university student leader and later as a fundraiser for up-and-coming politicians. The story asserts that Fang, a Chinese national, worked in cahoots with China's top spy agency and slowly widened her political circle across the nation from 2011 to 2015. The most salacious allegation is that she had a sexual or romantic relationship with two (unidentified) Midwestern mayors as part of her plot to cultivate contacts. This was a long game, according to the story, with the goal of establishing ties with small-time politicians who might reach the national stage down the line. One of the biggest targets was Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who was a city council member when Fang began working with his office. She would later raise funds for his congressional races, and she also raised money for Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom ran for president in 2020. Swalwell's office says he cut ties with Fang in 2015 when the FBI alerted him about their suspicions, and a Gabbard spokesperson says the congresswoman has no recollection of ever meeting or working with Fang. The story says Fang returned to China in 2015 as an FBI inquiry gained steam and seems to have cut ties with all her US contacts. The alleged operation offers a rare window into how Beijing has tried to gain access to and influence US political circles, writes Allen-Ebrahimian.

The bank, currently based in London, said today it's undertaking a significant reshaping of its business portfolio and redeploying resources to capture expected future growth opportunities. A large chunk of those lost jobs will be in Britain, where up to 8,000 jobs could go. A further concern for British staff is the possibility that the bank will move its headquarters out of London; that decision will come this year. With operations in more than 70 countries and around 51 million customers, HSBC also said it intends to sell its operations in Turkey and Brazil, a move that will cut its workforce by another 25,000.

The company previously announced the recall of 1.6 million cars, only through the 2007 model year, which were built with the faulty switch. The recall involves six cars: the Chevrolet Cobalt, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac G5, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion, and Saturn Sky. GM says it sold 95,000 faulty switches to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers for use as replacement parts. Of those, 90,000 were used to repair vehicles from the 2003-2007 model years. But 5,000 of the switches were used to fix cars from the 2008-2011 model years. GM said it doesn't know which cars got those 5,000 switches, so it needs to recall all of them. Of the cars being added to the recall, 824,000 were sold in the US. The ignition switches can move out of the run position and cause the car's engine to stall. It can also knock out power steering and power brakes, making the vehicle harder to maneuver, and disable the air bags.

A lower appeals court had upheld his conviction, but the state's high court agreed this year to review two key issues in the case, the AP reports. One involves the trial judge's decision to let prosecutors call five other accusers to testify about long-ago encounters with Cosby at his 2018 trial. The defense calls their testimony remote and unreliable. The high court will also consider whether the jury should have heard evidence that Cosby had given quaaludes to women in the past. The evidence came from Cosby's own deposition testimony in a related lawsuit.",Court to Look at 2 Issues in Cosby Appeal

It came hours after the 22-year-old junior from Linden, NJ, was charged with two counts of first-degree attempted murder and two counts of first-degree conspiracy to commit murder, making him the ninth current or former Rutgers football player to be arrested since the summer, reports NJ.com. Police determined Bullock initiated a plot to murder the family members of an acquaintance on Monday, per a release. The two intended victims, unaffiliated with the university, were ultimately uninjured, a prosecutor's rep says. Bullock graduated in 2014 from Linden High School, where he played linebacker and running back, per NJ.com. He then attended a private program meant to help recruit athletes to NCAA football programs before making the Rutgers team with a walk-on tryout in September 2017. ESPN reports the Scarlet Knight played at least one game this year but didn't register any statistics. His case follows the August arrests of eight other Rutgers football players charged in connection with alleged credit card fraud.

Some 23,000 ER visits each year are attributed to everything from herbal pills to vitamins that cause cardiovascular problems, severe allergic reactions, and vomiting, particularly in young adults, according to a new study from the FDA and CDC. They tracked ER visits from 63 hospitals over 10 years, per the New York Times and Time, and found about 10% of patients needed to be hospitalized; the study didn't review whether any deaths occurred. Though prescription drugs send 30 times as many people to the ER annually, most are older adults; 28% of people who visited the ER because of supplements were 20 to 34, and half of those visits involved weight-loss or energy aids, per NBC News. Dietary supplements aren't required to carry warning labels about side effects, don't require FDA approval, and are generally considered safe until proved otherwise, notes the Times. The system has failed, says a Harvard professor who calls the findings disheartening. It's failing to protect consumers from very serious harms. Industry officials claim half of all Americans use dietary supplements, meaning 23,000 ER visits represents a sliver of users.

We reject your demand for payment, the lawyer's letter informs the league per the sources; it claims no punishment is warranted because Sterling has done nothing wrong and says his due process rights have been violated.

Now we know just how quickly it has grown: A US official says the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (or TIDE) database has swelled from 540,000 to 875,000 names in five years, Reuters reports. Proponents emphasize it's not intended as a watch list : Suspected terrorists' children are on it, and Ford Motor Company is rumored to have an entry as well, reports the LA Times. Rather, TIDE is used to inform more specific databases, such as the FBI's no-fly list. An official tells Reuters that intelligence agencies' ability to pull the data they need from TIDE has only sharpened as the database has expanded.

Gen. Hiwa Abdullah says most of the freed 216 prisoners are in poor health and bear signs of abuse and neglect. He adds that about 40 children are among those released, while the rest are elderly. No reason was given for the release of the prisoners, who were originally abducted from the area around Sinjar. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when ISIS captured the northern Iraqi town, but hundreds were taken captive by the group, with some Yazidi women forced into slavery, according to international rights groups and Iraqi officials. In January, ISIS released some 200 Yazidi prisoners as well. At the time, Kurdish military officials said they believed the extremists released the prisoners as they were too much of a burden. Today's handover took place in Himera just southwest of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad.

Gentle reader, meet 20-year-old Katherine Stone of Washington state, who says she would like to lose hers so that she might rebuild her family's home, which burned down uninsured in 2014. And given that family homes aren't cheap, Stone is now selling her virginity to the highest-yet-still-at-least-not-totally-terrible bidder; bids are currently north of $400,000. People say you are supposed to do it for love, Stone tells CNN. But if you think about it, I am doing it because I love my family. To do it, Stone, who says she wants to be a lawyer, enlisted the help of brothel impresario Dennis Hof, who runs seven perfectly legal establishments of ill repute in Nevada. Hof, while acknowledging that helping Stone find a paying suitor is controversial, adds that it is her choice. I don't think it is a good idea for a girl to drink six tequilas and lose her virginity on the bathroom floor in a frat house. ... If she wants to (sell) it, I think that's great.

Syed is almost two decades into a life sentence for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, and the documentary films defense attorney C. Justin Brown following a meeting with prosecutors. The deal: plead guilty to Lee's murder and be released in 2022; the Baltimore Sun reports a rep for Maryland's attorney general confirmed the deal. Syed didn't take it because of the requirement he admit guilt. It's like I'd be exchanging one prison for another, Syed says in a phone call with filmmakers. The second revelation: DNA tests were conducted in 2018 on crime scene evidence, and none of it matched Syed. The Sun reports documents showed that roughly a dozen itemsâ€”including fingernail clippings, a rope, her clothing and jewelry, and a condom wrapperâ€”were tested. The tests identified only DNA from Lee and an unknown woman (the latter person's DNA was on the rope, per the New York Times). Brown says the fingernail clippings are particularly noteworthy: Prosecutors' position is that there was a struggle between Syed and Lee in her car, where they say she was strangled; samples taken from the car were DNA tested as well.

Because Facebook expects to cross the 500-investor mark this year, the 500 rule will kick in, requiring it to report its financial information quarterly. Sources says it likely wants to launch the IPO before that requirement would begin in April, hence the Q1 IPO. Another motivation behind a public offering could be increasing employee compensationâ€”especially after Facebook last year put the kibosh on workers selling their shares, likely prompting many to quit in order to do so.

The shots erupted late last night at the party where more than 100 mostly young adults had gathered at a home in the Cypress area of Houston's suburbs, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. A statement from that office said two suspects were being sought, but it did not elaborate. The office said a man and woman were dead and those hurt had injuries ranging from minor to critical. None of the victims were identified by name. Earlier, Thomas Gilliland, a spokesman with the sheriff's office, told the Houston Chronicle that some of the wounded suffered shots to the foot, ankle, and hip. He also told the paper that others fleeing the home had injuries such as twisted ankles. It was a pretty chaotic scene, Gilliland said, adding that deputies arriving at the scene saw some people lying on the ground and others running. The newspaper quoted witnesses as saying some people banged on doors for help afterward urging neighbors to call 911 amid scenes of crying and screaming.","2 Dead, 22 Hurt in Shooting at Texas Party"

Ars Technica reports New York City sixth-grader Mira Modi launched her own cybersecurity businessâ€”Diceware Passwordsâ€”this month. Diceware is a password-creation process that's been around for decades. You roll a six-sided die five times to make a five-digit number, which corresponds to a short English word. Do that six times, and you have a passphrase that it would take something like an entire country's security agency to crack, according to Diceware Passwords. Do it eight times, and the passphrase is unbreakable with any known technology and should be safe until at least 2050. (The key is the phrase's entropy, or randomness, explains the Next Web. I started this business because my mom was too lazy to roll dice so many times, so she paid me to roll dice and make passwords for her, Modi says on her website. Then I realized that other people wanted them, too. If you order a password from Modi, she'll roll her dice, handwrite your phrase on a piece of paper, and physically mail you the only copy, Ars Technica reports. On her website, Modi also recommends clients capitalize random letters or add symbols so their final password is not the exact same one that I gave you. She's sold about 30 so far.

The missile launches Sunday came as a ballistic missile fired from Yemen apparently targeted a Saudi air base near the Muslim holy city of Mecca, the deepest strike yet into the kingdom by Shiite rebels and their allies, the AP reports. Yemen's Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and their allies offered no reason for the launches, though they came after a Saudi-led airstrike targeting a funeral in Yemen's capital killed over 140 people and wounded 525 on Saturday. In a statement, the Navy said no American sailors were injured and no damage was done to the USS Mason, an Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyer whose home port is Norfolk, Va. Lt. Ian McConnaughey, a spokesman for US Navy Forces Central Command, said Monday it's unclear if the USS Mason was specifically targeted, though the missiles were fired in its direction over an hour, starting at around 7pm. An American defense official said the USS Mason used onboard defensive measures after the first missile was fired, but it wasn't clear if that caused the missile to splash harmlessly into the sea. The destroyer at the time of the missile fire was north of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which serves as a gateway for oil tankers headed to Europe through the Suez Canal, the official said.

Lots of attention has been paid to the long mandatory sentences doled out to nonviolent drug offenders, but Marc Mauer argues that those convicted of violent crimes shouldn't be spending most of their lives behind bars, either. The idea is grounded in both humanitarian and public-safety concerns, he writes, noting that inmates often age out of the criminal mindset. And from a more practical point of view, it's expensive to care for older prisoners, all the more so given that most of them pose little danger to society. No other industrialized country keeps so many people behind bars for so long, he writes. The excessively lengthy incarceration of offendersâ€”yes, even for violent crimesâ€”is counterproductive, costly, and inhumane, writes Mauer. To remedy this problem, Congress and state legislative bodies should establish an upper limit of 20 years in prison as a maximum penalty, except in unusual cases such as a serial rapist who has not been amenable to treatment in prison or a mass murderer. Review boards made up of psychologists and other experts could assess inmates at the 20-year mark to determine whether it makes sense to keep them locked up. Because, yes, that violent 18-year-old may indeed pose a danger to society on the day of his sentencing, but who can say what he'll be like 20 years down the road?

Now regulators have slapped fines on two meatpacking plants and triggered a fresh round of finger-pointing over worker safety amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Washington Post reports. Levied this week, fines against a JBS plant in Colorado and a Smithfield Foods plant in South Dakota total about $29,000â€”a pittance, some say, for companies that rake in billions of dollars in revenue per year. These tiny fines are nothing to [meat plant owners], says Kim Cordova, president of the UFCW Local 7 for JBS workers. They give an incentive to make these workers work faster and harder in the most unsafe working conditions imaginable. But JBS and Smithfield pushed back, saying they had to sort out worker safety on their own. We took extraordinary measures ... to keep our employees as healthy and safe as possible, a Smithfield rep told CBS News. Now the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which calls its six-month probe exhaustive, is telling both companies to increase social distancing or put up barriers between workers. But JBS and Smithfield have already opposed social-distancing measures and quarantines that kept workers at homeâ€”and increased the pressure on those who did show up, the AP reports.

In addition to running out of money, the troubled program also has a growing backlog: Many applicants wait years before receiving benefits. But at the same time, many others are overpaidâ€”last year, $1.4 billion was overpaid, mostly to people who no longer qualified after getting new jobs. Solutions are hard to come by; trustees want Congress to reallocate money from the retirement program to the disability program, but that would only be a short-term solution that would also hurt the retirement program.

But that momentum didn't stop Sterling from suing the NBA for $1 billion in damages, alleging that the league illegally wrenched the team from him, reports the Wall Street Journal. Not so, says the league, because wife Shelly had every right to strike a deal with Ballmer on her own once her husband was deemed mentally unfit. The kicker there is that Shelly Sterling, as part of her to deal to sell the team, indemnified the league against any lawsuits from her husband. Which is to say, she would have to pay that $1 billion in damages herself if by some long shot he wins in court, reports AP. The league, for its part, is brushing of the lawsuit as entirely baseless. And the final footnote belongs to the Upshot blog of the New York Times, which crunches the numbers to reveal that Donald Sterling would make a return on his investment of 15,900% under the Ballmer deal. Sterling bought the club for $12.5 million in 1981.",Sterling Sues NBA for $1B

He died at his home in New Rochelle, NY, on Wednesday at age 85, the New York Times reports. In the 1950s, Silver helped pioneer hard bop, a driving, rhythmic music that critics considered the antithesis of cool jazz. Silver's earthy tunes drew on his love for R&B, gospel, Latin, bebop, and Afro-Portuguese music of Cape Verde, where his father came from, DownBeat reports. Musical composition should bring happiness and joy to people and make them forget their troubles, Silver once said. Born in 1928 in Connecticut, Silver got his break playing for saxophonist Stan Getz and went on to form the Jazz Messengers with Art Blakey in 1953. About two years later, Silver began carving out his own career with a quintet that made classic recordings on Blue Note Records like Song for My Father and Finger Poppin'. The group changed players over the years and served as breeding grounds for future greats like Joe Henderson, Hank Mobley, Blue Mitchell, and Woody Shaw, notes Jazz Times. Silver broke up the band in the 1970s and went on to write and perform other musicâ€”like self-help holistic metaphysical works that critics rarely likedâ€”but Silver was already an icon of jazz.

We marshalled all our resources and we can gratefully say that she was able to be reunited with her family, says an official with the AG's criminal bureau. Abigail was last seen Oct. 9 after leaving Kennett High School in Conway. Police said she walked her normal route toward her house and sent several texts between 2:30pm and 3pm. But she never made it home. Police did reveal several months ago that Abigail had written home to her mother. When the letter surfaced, FBI Special Agent In Charge Kieran Ramsey said there was the possibility that Abigail had run away but that someone could still be coercing her into staying away from home. The long and short of it is, quite honestly, we are just happy that she's home safe and sound right now, Ramsey said yesterday. Foster says Abigail's mother told authorities today we are the happiest people on earth.","Girl, 15, Who Went Missing 9 Months Ago Back Home"

The AP didn't print the listâ€”though it published a story deeming Trump's philanthropy elusive â€”but it's since handed the doc over to the Washington Post, which upon further analysis of entries often written in cryptic internal shorthand finds no gifts were out of Trump's own pocket. Instead, donations included major land-conservation deals and lots of giveaways, including free rounds of golf offered by his courses during charity auctions and raffles. And many of the gifts come from not Trump himself, but from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which is mainly funded by others (including the WWE's McMahon family) and to which Trump hasn't written a check since 2008, per public tax filings. He's using [the foundation] as a kind of checkbook, with other people's money, a faculty member at Indiana University's School of Philanthropy says. It's not wrong. It's not unique. But it's poor philanthropy. Trump's philanthropic predilections tend toward a particular group, and not all of them charities: namely, Trump's business and political interests and even the occasional celebrity (Serena Williams scored a free framed photo of him and a free plane ride to Florida). While Bill Gates has been vanquishing malaria, for example, Trump's been sending funds to conservatives who could help his GOP standing. Allen Weisselberg, CFO of the Trump Organization, tells the Post that while the items on the list don't include personal cash donations, the list isn't comprehensive and Trump has pulled out his own wallet, though he prefers to be discreet about it. We want to keep them quiet, Weisselberg says. He doesn't want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. Others also say he lives up to his Grateful Millionaire nickname, doing things no one ever hears aboutâ€”including reportedly paying off the mortgage for a couple who helped him when his limo broke down.

The Detroit Free Press reports on the clamor after the car was announced, with hundreds of potential purchasers flooding Lincoln dealerships with phone calls when the news broke in mid-December. One customer was one of these people who could have whatever they wanted, and he wanted to match the Lincoln with his aircraft, Robert Parker, Lincoln's marketing director, says. Parker says December was the brand's best month in two years, and that response for this vehicle came even from outside the US, including from Dubai and Shanghai. A limited-edition 2020 version is in the works, though there will be variations. Recipients of the 2019 model will start getting delivery of their sedans over the summer.

But when she realized her bus driver had collapsed after suffering a heart attack, that's what she did. I just realized that there's no one driving this bus â€¦ I need to do something, Rumer tells NBC Philadelphia. So the 17-year-old, who says she was simply the closest person who knew how to drive, grabbed the wheel and steered the bus out of oncoming traffic.

We tried to give him a good home, says Gorecki. Of his brother-in-law he says, He loved (the alligator), it was his pride and joy. The gator's presence, he says, was an open secret. Everybody knew Jaxson. Animal control also found two cat carcasses in Jaxson's crate, and they're asking neighbors who've lost small pets at any point in the past four decades to get in touch. Theyâ€™re basically saying weâ€™re taking the animals and feeding them to the alligator, and thatâ€™s not true, Gorecki tells CBS. The siblings say they also took care of neutered feral cats brought to them by a rescue group, but they never fed them to Jaxson.

New York City was rocked by the sensational crime, in which a young woman jogging alone in Central Park at night was bludgeoned, raped, tied up and left for dead. Five teenage boysâ€”four black and one Latinoâ€”confessed to the crime after two days under intense police interrogation during which they say they were denied sleep and food, although each person accused another of the actual rape. Trump inserted himself into the conversation two weeks after the attack by buying full-page ads in several New York papers. The ads didn't address the controversy directly, but it was pretty obvious what Trump was talking about when he called for the city to BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY in big, bold type. In 2002, a separate man confessed to the crime, and his DNA was matched to semen found at the scene. No DNA evidence linking the teens to the crime was ever found. The Central Park 5 were exonerated by the legal system, and in 2014, the city of New York paid the group $41 million to settle the caseâ€”a settlement Trump called a disgrace. He repeatedly refused to apologize for his stance, and just this week, Trump doubled down on his decades-old conviction.

Five Disney workersâ€”two of them vaccinatedâ€”have been diagnosed with measles, and the park says that workers who came in contact with them and can't provide either vaccination records or proof of immunity have been placed on paid leave, reports the Los Angeles Times. It's not clear how many visitors may have encountered the infected workers, whom Disney's chief medical officer refers to as cast members. She says a few of the cast members have returned to work after being medically cleared, reports the OC Register. In an Orange County high school around 20 miles from Disneyland, at least 24 unvaccinated students have been told to stay home until Jan. 29 because they may have been exposed to the disease by an infected classmate earlier this month, reports CBS.

Pithovirus sibericum, a member of a recently discovered class of giant viruses, was found 100 feet deep in the frozen ground. It only infects amoebas, but the researchers who uncovered it fear that plenty more ancient viruses are locked into the permafrost and could be unleashed as it thaws, Nature reports. The region is becoming both warmer and more accessible, which is a recipe for disaster, one of the researchers says. If you start having industrial explorations, people will start to move around the deep permafrost layers. Through mining and drilling, those old layers will be penetrated and this is where the danger is coming from, he tells the BBC, warning that if it is true that these viruses survive in the same way those amoeba viruses survive, then smallpox is not eradicated from the planetâ€”only the surface. It's not clear, however, whether other viruses are as robust as the Siberian giant, which USA Today notes is as many as 20 times bigger than a typical virus but still dwarfed by a grain of sand.

Now CUNY has revised his visiting professor salaryâ€”to $1, the New York Times reports. The original salary was first uncovered by Gawker, which reported Petraeus would do a seminar and two lectures a year for the money (though later revised down to $150,000)â€”with grad students taking care of things like course research, administration, and grading â€”while the average first-time adjunct professor at the college is paid $25,000 for a full-time course load (the average full-time faculty member makes $89,768, adds the Times). After several weeks of public criticism, CUNY announced the pay cut today. The general never was taking on this teaching assignment for the money, says Petraeus' lawyer, per the Times.

Rhea and Mimas have both suffered from what the space agency calls a violent history that's left them cratered with surface irregularities.

But the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports a new study published Thursday has another explanation. Researchers found that 911 calls related to crime dropped 20% in Milwaukee following the horrific beating of unarmed black man Frank Jude by off-duty cops in 2004. The effect lasted for more than a year, totaling more than 22,000 fewer crime-related 911 calls, according to the Atlantic. And 56% of the decrease occurred in black neighborhoods, despite black neighborhoods making up only 31% of Milwaukee. Researchers are calling it the Jude effect. Researchers found similar declines after police killed Sean Bell in 2006 in New York City and assaulted Danyall Simpson in 2007 in Milwaukee. Police violence de-legitimizes the criminal justice system in the eyes of the African-American community, researcher Matthew Desmond tells the Journal Sentinel. The study concludes that incidents of police violence make the city as a whole...less safe, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Jude's beating was followed by a 32% increase in murders in Milwaukee. The spike in homicides can potentially be attributed to the drop in 911 calls, which are used by police for all sorts of crime fighting.

DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack said his six-month review firmed up an alibi and convinced him it was a manifest impossibility that Jack McCullough could have been anywhere near the area when Maria Ridulph disappeared in the small community of Sycamore. The girl vanished on Dec. 3, 1957, and was found dead several months later. The slaying remained a mystery for decades before McCullough, who was initially cleared in the case, was charged in 2011. McCullough, now 75, was a neighbor at the time of the killing. He was found guilty in 2012 after a renewed push to solve the case, and sentenced to life in prison. New evidence included recently subpoenaed phone records proving that McCullough made a collect call to his parents from a phone booth in the city of Rockford, about 35 miles from Sycamore, just minutes after the abduction took place. Testimony that the abduction had taken place earlier has been discredited, Schmack said, meaning there was no possibility McCullough could have committed the crime and driven to Rockford in time to place that call.

James Cooper Jr. and Mark Branco were fired by the Bellagio after the scheme came to light, and they were arrested in July 2014, authorities said Thursday. They're named with friends Jeffrey Martin and Anthony Granito in a 60-count indictment filed Wednesday. The charges include cheating at gambling and theftâ€”felonies that could get the defendants decades in prison. Cheating is common, one official says. We arrest 350 to 500 people a year for cheating or theft from a casino. But to have it go this long and for this much money is unusual. Arrests came after another dealer became suspicious and notified casino investigators. Gambling regulators and fraud control agents spent hours reviewing security video, combing through the suspects' financial records, watching the men work and gamble, and interviewing co-workers and witnesses. The dice game scam involved the dealers accepting late or unclear bets and paying out winnings at times when colleagues and supervisors generally weren't aware what was happening, says a Nevada State Gaming Control Board deputy chief. A longtime former casino dealer who now works with a Las Vegas security firm terms the scheme a dealer-agent scam. He says a craps table can get crowded, with players and spectators surrounding casino dealers, floor supervisor, and others. If you have a dirty inside person, he can slide a bet to the boxman and then just pay out whatever the (dice) roll is, he says. If the bet is not clearly identified, it can be ambiguous for when a payout happens. Other cheating can involve scammers trying to bet late or confuse the stickman during the roll of the dice, he says.","Dealers, Pals Charged With Stealing $1M From Bellagio"

The last song that really fits the bill is Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You, and that came out in 1994. It's not for stars' lack of trying: Lady Gaga, for instance, had a Christmas song back in 2008, and Coldplay released one in 2010â€”but you probably don't remember either one. Yet much of the Christmas fare that comes out these days amounts to a rehashing of old favorites. Even the new stuff sounds sort of old : The original songs on new holiday albums by Kelly Clarkson and Leona Lewis are reminiscent of Phil Spector. What gives?

Center Township police testified at Roxanne Rimer's hearing yesterday that she was arrested after stealing earrings from a Kohl's store Jan. 14. Police testified that a loss prevention officer detained Rimer, 27, who gave a fake name and claimed to be a juvenile. Before police could arrive, Rimer ran away and jumped into a car driven by her grandfather, police said. That car was pulled over moments later, and Rimer was cuffed and placed in the back of a police cruiser, screaming, Mommy! Mommy! authorities said. Officers say while police searched her grandfather's car, the thin woman squeezed through a partition in the cruiser and into the front seat. She zoomed off, smashing into her grandfather's car as she drove away, police said. Which leads us to this quote, from the local police chief, as per WPXI: With her back turned and her hands cuffed behind her back, she manages to put it in gear and drive. And from what we can gather, she drove at very high speeds with that position somehow manipulating the gears and steering the wheel. After a 10-mile chase, she crashed into a hillside and jumped out, police said. She faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, fleeing and eluding police, and robbery. Her attorney argued against the aggravated assault chargeâ€”filed because the officers were endangeredâ€”because he said Rimer didn't intend to injure anyone and nobody was hurt. But the judge agreed with the prosecutor, who said Rimer put both the police and her grandfather at risk.

The allegations in the latest lawsuits filed by Michael Egan III are substantially similar to his legal action against Singer, which accuses the director of abusing him between the ages of 15 and 17 in Los Angeles and Hawaii. The new lawsuits were filed in federal court in Hawaii against former Fox television executive Garth Ancier, theater producer Gary Wayne Goddard, and David A. Neuman, a former television executive with Current TV and Disney. Egan, 31, claims he was lured into a sex ring run by a former digital entertainment company executive, Marc Collins-Rector, with promises of auditions for acting, modeling, and commercial jobs. He says he was put on the company's payroll as an actor and forced to have sex with adult men at parties within Hollywood's entertainment industry. Egan appeared at a news conference yesterday alongside his mother, who tearfully described her efforts to report alleged abuses to the FBI in 1999 and 2000. Bonnie Mound said she wrote several letters, and questioned why those letters and information her son provided in interviews with an agent did not result in criminal charges. The FBI has said it could not discuss specifically what Egan told them, however, the agency denied last week that it had ignored any information about Singer.",3 More Hollywood Bigwigs Named in Sex Abuse Suit

Now they're speaking out to let the world know that something called the Choking Game killed their little boy and to warn other parents so the same thing doesn't happen to them, the Washington Post reports. Also known by names including Cloud Nine, Five Minutes in Heaven, Blackout, and Good Kid's High, the game involves briefly cutting off the flow of oxygen to the brain, resulting in a euphoric feeling. But it's dangerous, especially when played alone; some children use belts slung from doorknobs to achieve the high. The advocacy group GASP estimates nearly 400 children died from playing the Choking Game between 1995 and 2007, but notes that it's difficult to track exact numbers since many of the deaths are reported as suicides. Indeed, rumors went around that Garrett had committed suicide, which is one of the reasons his parents are speaking out. Please know that his senseless death was not intentional. He took this terrible 'game' too far, they write in a Facebook post that has been shared more than 1,500 times so far. He was so young and impressionable, he didnâ€™t know what he was doing, and made a terrible mistake.

Police initially said about 10 were killed at the forested camp on the island of Utoya. It's taken time to search the area.

A suspect in the shootings, and the Oslo explosion that killed seven people, was arrested. Though police did not release his name, Norwegian national broadcaster NRK identified him as 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik. A police official said the suspect appears to have acted alone in both attacks, and that it seems like that this is not linked to any international terrorist organizations at all.

The reason comes down to legal precedent: A higher court ruled last year that another chimpanzee, Tommy, is property, not a person, reports the AP. In May, a lawyer had argued in court for the Nonhuman Rights Project that 8-year-old chimps Hercules and Leo are autonomous and self-determining beings that deserve similar rights as humans. He presented hundreds of pages of opinions from a range of experts like zoologists and biologists who all felt similarly: cognitively, chimps are an advanced species. In a somewhat sympathetic 33-page decision, State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe called the effort to extend rights to chimps understandable and noted such a suit may one day succeed, giving the reasoning that legal person and human being aren't necessarily synonymous, reports NBC News. But she added: The past mistreatment of humans, whether slaves, women, indigenous people or others, as property, does not, however, serve as a legal predicate or appropriate analogy for extending to nonhumans the status of legal personhood. The group plans to appeal the decision, reports the Wall Street Journal, which notes that more lawsuits are likely to be filed on behalf of animals held in captivity.

All of the justices agreed to let a lower court ruling stand that blocked an Indiana ban against abortions solely motivated by the sex, race, or disability of the fetus, while also upholding that state's law that fetal remains be buried or cremated. Ginsburg, however, noted (along with Justice Sonia Sotomayor) that she would've kept the whole Indiana law intact, and demonstrated that she is not going quietly on any abortion-related compromise, per CNN. This case implicates the right of a woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the state, she wrote in the lone dissenting opinion, a brief two pages. Meanwhile, in his own opinion, Thomas wrote 10 times that amount, per BuzzFeed. Not only did he make it clear he'd support Indiana's abortion ban, but he noted this law and other laws like it promote a State's compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics, citing Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger's advocacy of birth control to control population. Thomas says Sanger's birth control arguments could also apply to abortion, though conceding she didn't push abortion as a eugenics method: Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can now be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics, such as a particular sex or disability, he wrote.

The result is stronger storms in the northwest Pacific Ocean, with North America feeling the biggest effects, reports LiveScience.

From 1980 to 2010 (the most recent available year), those earning more than $200,000 have enjoyed the largest decline in total taxes as a percentage of income, and 85% of households earning more than $25,000 per year have also seen the percentage of their income that goes to taxes drop. The group that got hit hardest? Those earning less than $25,000, only about half of which have seen their tax burden decline. While federal tax rates have been cut across the board since 1980, state and local taxes (which typically take a larger percentage of the lowest earners' income) have increased in most of the country, offsetting much of the federal savingsâ€”in six states, local tax increases have exceeded the decline in federal rates. Overall, about 31 cents of each dollar earned goes to the government, about the same as in 1980. However, changes to the tax code have seen the taxes paid by a household earning $350,000 fall to 42.1% from 49% (adjusted for inflation).

In a new book, former CIA analyst Brian Latell draws on Cuban sources and declassified US documents to argue that Castro was at least aware of Lee Harvey Oswald's intentions. According to the book, Castroâ€™s Secretsâ€”the CIA and Cubaâ€™s Intelligence Machine, Castro knew that Oswald had been refused a visa at the Cuban embassy in Mexico City, and vowed to kill Kennedy to prove his Communist allegiance. I donâ€™t say Fidel Castro ordered the assassination, I donâ€™t say Oswald was under his control, says Latell. But did Fidel want Kennedy dead? Yes. ...

Dr. Kevin Smith says the risks associated with older fathersâ€”studies have pointed to higher rates of autism and a range of other mental disordersâ€”are enough of a problem that the government should consider setting up a state-supported sperm bank where men can deposit their swimmers at 18 and come back for them if they decide to father a child in their 40s or later. It's time we took seriously the issue of paternal age and its effect on the next generation of children, Smith tells the BBC, which notes that private sperm banking costs around $300 a year, but also that the UK's National Health Service could probably bring costs down considerably. Fertility experts, however, tell the BBC that the suggestion is ridiculous for several reasons, including the fact that the risks associated with older fathers are really quite small, and the fact that most men's sperm doesn't freeze all that well. The chairman of the British Fertility Society tells the BBC that a national sperm bank isn't needed because it not only provides a very artificial approach to procreation, but also a false sense of security as the technology does not guarantee a baby. In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, Smith says health education to promote earlier fatherhood and incentives for young sperm donors should also be considered.

Ray Tomlinson was 74, and heart failure is suspected, Ars Technica reports, From the official Twitter account of Gmail: Thank you, Ray Tomlinson, for inventing email and putting the @ sign on the map. #RIP. Tomlinson in 1971 wrote the first email program for ARPANET, a precursor to the Internet, while working at Bolt Beranek and Newman (now Raytheon BBN Technologies). He reportedly showed it to a colleague, saying, Donâ€™t tell anyone! This isnâ€™t what weâ€™re supposed to be working on, the Guardian reports. In one interview, Tomlinson reportedly said he created email mostly because it seemed like a neat idea. Early email test messages were, he said, entirely forgettable, and the first email was sent between side-by-side machines. As for the @ symbol, Tomlinson wrote on his website: The at sign just makes sense. The purpose of the at sign (in English) was to indicate a unit price (for example, 10 items @ $1.95). I used the at sign to indicate that the user was 'at' some other host rather than being local. A Raytheon rep tells the Guardian that by choosing the symbol, Tomlinson likely saved it from extinction. It is a symbol that probably would have gone away if not for email, she says. Born in Amsterdam, NY, in 1941, Tomlinson went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and MIT, later joining the company that would become Raytheon.

As first noted in the Sunday Times, the company will pay out nearly $397 million in bonuses to UK staffers, which comes out to about $1.1 million each, with payments parceled out between now and the end of 2018. By doing so, Facebook can count the bonuses as taxable expenses and slash a large amount off the net profit it has to pay corporation taxes on, the Week explains. But while the soon-to-be wealthy staffers are likely celebrating, the British government is probably feeling a certain amount of frustration: Just last week, Facebook said it would revamp its tax structure in the name of more transparency amid criticism it was avoiding taxes in the UK, agreeing to stop diverting sales through Ireland, the BBC notes. In 2014, Facebook pulled a similar stunt, with the $50 million in stock awards it paid out to employees in the UK resulting in a meager $6,135 corporate tax bill, even though its revenue that year in the UK was close to $150 million, per the Mirror and the AP. And apparently it's not the only company to take advantage of this loophole, with Amazon and other multinational corporations working off of similar tax arrangements. Some say, however, that the company's fair share of taxes will still get paidâ€”the plan will simply shift the tax burden to the millionaire employees, who are already said to be paid an average salary of nearly $300,000 each and are taxed at a 45% rate.

Each year since 2011, the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins have lost about 4 trillion gallons. What's more, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains is just half of what earlier estimates suggested, and it's one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when California's population was half what it is now, a researcher says. That means less snow melt and more absorption of sunlight into the ground, helping warm the planet and leading to drier conditions that make it more difficult to get snow water to reservoirs, he adds. It takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it, says the water study's leader.",California's Massive Drought Deficit: 11T Gallons of Water

Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council has updated its alcohol guidelines for the first time in a decade, and it now says that to reduce health risks related to alcohol, adults should limit themselves to 10 standard alcoholic drinks per week, which comes out to about 1.4 per day. (The previous recommendation was a maximum of 14 per week.) But, as the Guardian notes, if you're not drinking every single day of the week, the new guideline for the maximum number of drinks in one day is four. The good news is that the council's three years of research on the matter show that limiting your weekly beverages to no more than 10 reduces your lifetime risk of dying from an injury or illness related to alcohol consumption to less than 1 in 100. The new guidelines come after the council found strengthened links between alcohol consumption and cancer, Australia's ABC News reports. It also found less strength for the alcohol is good for you argument for drinking, say, a glass or two of red wine a day. The guidelines, of course, also recommend pregnant women (or women planning to get pregnant) and children under the age of 18 not drink at all.

Meanwhile, US dietary guidelines still define moderate alcohol consumption as no more than one drink per day for women, two for men.","2 Drinks a Day Is OK? Not Anymore, Says Council"

That's what he, too, will be making, down from about $1 million a year, until the company's profits surpass the level they were at last year, before the raises went into effect. I haven't even thought about that at all, too much, he tells ABC News. My life started pretty simple, in a lot of ways. I don't have a lot of financial obligations or debts. He owns a nice three-bedroom home and has been driving his Audi for 12 years. I may have to scale back a little bit, but nothing I'm not willing to do, the 30-year-old says. I'm single. I just have a dog. Not that he doesn't enjoy the finer things in life: He has lots of rich friends, and he often gets invited onto their yachts or private planes, he says: I have an incredibly luxurious life, for some reason, but I don't end up paying for a lot of it. He adds that he wasn't making $1 million because I need that much to live, but that's what it would cost to replace me as a CEO. And that in itself is a problem, he notes: I think CEO pay is way out of whack. ... I'm a big believer in less: The more you have, sometimes the more complicated your life gets. But will Price's move become a trend? Likely not, experts tell MainStreet, ABC News, and CBS News. It just doesn't make economic sense for really large companies that have a lot of people like that to give huge raises like this, explains a labor economist.

Most recently, Great Lakes Brewing Company in Ohio teamed up with archaeologists from the University of Chicago in an effort to make a 5,000-year-old Sumerian beer, reports the New York Times. Unfortunately, the ancient Sumerians didn't leave step-by-step instructions. The recipe was gleaned from a 1800 BC song called Hymn to Ninkasi (Ninkasi was the goddess of beer), and required the brewers and archaeologists to use ceramic vessels, heated outdoors on a fire fueled by manure, for maximum authenticity. The result? The beer was warm, sour, and full of bacteria.

But the scientists who found it on a seabed near Iceland in 2006 now say further analysis has revealed that it was an incredible 507 years old, reports CBS. The researchers, who didn't realize how old Ming was when they first found it, opened the ancient clam up to judge its age by counting growth rings inside its hinge ligaments. That's because the rings are better protected there, scientist Paul Butler tells ScienceNordic, which notes that Ming was named for the Chinese dynasty that ruled when it was born. But the rings were so close together that scientists ended up having to count the rings on the outside to be accurate, leading CBS to point out that Ming could have lived on, had scientists just started there.

Police say the two used retractable batons to pummel the porcupines while a third officer recorded them, then posted the video to internal police Snapchat groups, WGME reports. Authorities say Rolerson admitted to pepper-spraying one of the animals before he beat it. These porcupines were in their natural habitat and causing no harm, an Aug. 29 statement from fellow officer Anne Griffith to her supervisor noted, per the Courier Gazette.

As Bloomberg reports, the US-led embargo on Tehran's oil has proven devastatingly effective since it began July 1, dropping the Iranians' exports by 52%â€”the equivalent of $48 billion a year, or 10% of Iran's economy. The silver lining for the rest of the world is that increased Saudi and US production have combined with waning demand to actually decrease the cost of crude by 0.7%, against experts' worst fears. That's an election-year victory Obama can tout, notes Bloomberg. Itâ€™s been an unqualified success, says one expert. In the end the US and Europeans got their cake and they ate it too, because volumes are down and prices are down. More cruddy news for Tehran: The US Congress can apparently agree on nothing save making Iran's life as miserable as possible, and yesterday passed increased sanctions to tighten the chokehold on the regime.

The rugged little Douglas fir had survived more than 600 years in a remote part of New Mexico, but the Albuquerque Journal reports that it died amid the state's current drought. We had a moment of silence to pay our respects, wrote a researcher who made the discovery last month on the lava flows near Grants. Yoda was short (7 feet) and gnarly as far as Douglas firs go, but a previous analysis of its rings showed that it had been alive since at least 1406. The Journal points out that New Mexico has been in a drought for 15 years now, and the hot, dry weather is taking a toll on trees of all kinds. Researchers say that Yoda had survived many a dry spell over its lifetime, including an especially brutal one that lasted 25 years in the 16th century. A separate post by the Journal's John Fleck notes that Yoda was not the oldest tree in its area by a long shotâ€”a nearby Douglas fir is 1,275 years old.

On the other hand, Hafez claims to play for Barcelona's soccer team, have attended Oxford University, and have been in a relationship (though the 11-year-old is now single, it seems).

Unearthed documents show how one of the most controversial figures in American medical history, Walter Freemanâ€”who made the ice-pick-through-the-eye, transorbital method famous and used lobotomies to treat practically everything from delinquency to a pain in the neck, one VA memo notesâ€”swayed the organization in favor of the procedure, despite the fact that only a third of patients were able to lead a productive life afterward. After doctors saw Freeman perform a lobotomy in 1943, a VA report recommended the surgery be performed on veterans suffering from mental illnesses. The memo, which noted a lobotomy does not demand a high degree of surgical skill, was approved. The US government went on to lobotomize some 2,000 veterans with Freeman in the lead, the WSJ notes.

Wholesale prices saw an even steeper increase, rising 1.8% in June and 9.2% year-over-year.

Court papers filed in the case against five alleged human smugglers provide more insight into how the stash house came to be, and how police uncovered it. The Houston Chronicle reports that the tip came from a worried grandmother, who reached out to local police after being contacted by a smuggler who demanded $13,000 in order to transport her daughter and two young grandchildren to Chicagoâ€”a trip the woman said her daughter had paid the smugglers $15,000 to facilitate. Pay the ransom, the grandmother was told, or the smugglers would make her family disappear. KPRC previously reported the 24-year-old and her children didn't show up at a prescribed meeting place last Tuesday night. The grandmother's tip brought police to the Pearland-area home; neighbors told KHOU they had no inkling of what was going on inside, but it didn't take police long to figure it out: One set of officers stopped a Ford Mustang that was exiting the property and noticed a black semi-automatic handgun protruding from beneath the front passenger seat ; other officers saw three men jump a fence and flee; still a third group observed men wearing only underwear inside, and called the Department of Homeland Security. Why the lack of clothing? Per the filing, the alleged smugglers locked up their hostages' clothes and shoes to make fleeing difficult; deadbolt locks, boarded-up windows, a wooden paddle, stun gun, and firearms also assisted to that end. Those held there, some for at least six weeks, hailed from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. An initial court appearance is today scheduled for the five accused, who are charged with hostage-taking and violence with a firearm.

Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are all operating under international bailout programs, and officials fear a bank run in Spain, fallout from Greece's upcoming election, and an increasingly dire global impact. Germany appears willing to pool EU debt, but only if member nations agree to stricter controls and some kind of central supervision of government spending, reports the New York Times. Finding the way to more Europe, not less is the task for Europe's leaders now, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday. One likely scenario is a plan to combine much of Europeâ€™s bad debt into a single fund with an aim to pay it off over 25 years. Accompanying that would be an expansion of executive power in Brussels over member nations' fiscal targets, as well as supervision of banks, and Europe-wide deposit insurance, notes the Times. We will discuss to what extent we need to put systemically relevant banks under a specific European supervisory authority so that national interests do not play such a large role, Merkel said yesterday. The plan faces stiff resistance from the powerful German banks, which argue that European-wide deposit insurance would mean using German savings to prop up weak banks beyond their borders, and weaken German institutions in turn, notes the Wall Street Journal.

Officials have confirmed that a 1960 Studebaker found in a creek last year contained the remains of the two 17-year-oldsâ€”and they appear to be the victims of a car crash, not foul play, the AP reports. The car was in the highest gear and the lights were on when it crashed, say investigators who suspect a tire blew when the girls were on their way to an end-of-school party, sending the car into the creek where it lay for 42 years until it was exposed by drought. Investigators do not believe alcohol was a factor. The girls were found in the car's front seats, and the forensic pathology and anthropology reports indicate that there's no type of injury that would be consistent with or caused by foul play or inappropriate conduct, the state's attorney general told reporters. A high school classmate already serving a 227-year sentence for rape and kidnapping was charged in 2007 with murdering the girls, but charges were dropped after prosecutors found that a jailhouse informant had lied.

It makes sense based on some of the [modeling] we did 12 months ago, that some time [within] 18 to 24 months after [the crash] this could be the area the debris would have ended up in, he tells the Guardian. A map that Pattiaratchi provided to Business Insider illustrates the spread of the debris over different time periods, from zero to six months after the crash to 18 to 24 months after, and Reunion Island sits squarely as the end destination in the 18-to-24-month range. Meanwhile, another Australian oceanographer tells the New York Times that even if the debris proves to be from Flight 370, using that info to try to backtrack along ocean currents to find the bulk of the wreckage would, as the paper puts it, be akin to using modeling of big-city crowd flows to try to predict the travels of a random person encountered on the street.

It was a source of pride, says Tina Cordova, a former Tularosa resident whose father was 3 at the time of the test. However, it became a source of angst after many residents developed cancer and blamed it for their health problems. Today marks the 70th anniversary of the test that took place as part of the Manhattan Project. But while the state holds commemorative events, Tularosa residents press for federal compensation. Most residents back then lacked phones and radios, so they believed Army officials who said it was just an ammunition explosion, despite the raining ash. Cordova says residents weren't told about the dangers and often picnicked at the test site and took artifacts, including radioactive green glass. She says the aftermath caused rare forms of cancer for many of the 30,000 people living in the area, including her own dad, who died in 2013; she believes his illnesses were related to the test's aftermath.

It started when the banker, Blake Pollock, heard Robertson's story and shared it with the Free Press. Then Wayne State University student Evan Leedy raised more than $310,000 for the factory worker on GoFundMe. Today, a local car dealer gave Robertson a fully loaded 2015 Ford Taurus to make his commute easier. The dealership's manager explains that he has enough trouble getting his own people to work on time: There's nobody who deserves it more than him, he says. I've never picked up a hitchhiker in my life, [but] I was curious, says Pollock of the day he gave Robertson a lift and heard his story. Once Pollock spread the news, the story quickly caught the attention of national media; ABC even chose him as Person of the Week. After launching the funding campaign, Robertson met Leedy on Monday at a local pub, according to a Wayne State University press release. Robertson is kind of a shy person, says Leedy. He doesn't like accepting help. This is why he's been walking back and forth to work for 10 years. Meanwhile, Robertson's grinding commute has shone a spotlight on Detroit's public-transportation issues: That story is heartbreaking, and it's not necessary, says the city's transit chief.

The California jury awarded Alva and Alberta Pilliod, a couple in their 70s who blame the herbicide for their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, $1 billion each in punitive damages and $55 million in compensatory damages, the BBC reports. In March, a man was awarded $80 million in a similar case. Last year, a former groundskeeper was awarded $289 million, which was reduced to $78.5 million on appeal. Bayer, which inherited the lawsuits when it bought Monsanto, has around 13,400 other Roundup lawsuits pending, and the heavy losses have caused a 30% drop in its share price and a shareholder revolt, the Wall Street Journal reports. Investors have urged Bayerâ€”which still insists the product is safe to useâ€”to reach a settlement with plaintiffs, though analysts say efforts will be complicated by the fact that Roundup is still being sold and has no warning label, meaning the pool of plaintiffs blaming the product for cancer could keep expanding, the Journal notes. Lawyers for the Pilliods described the huge award as historic. The jury saw internal company documents demonstrating that, from Day 1, Monsanto has never had any interest in finding out whether Roundup is safe, said attorney Brent Wisner. Bayer, arguing that the jury had been presented with cherry-picked findings from a small number of studies, said it plans to appeal.",Couple With Cancer Awarded $2B in Roundup Lawsuit

Wilson, both academics from Stanford University, have won the Nobel Prize in Economics and will split the $1.1 million prize for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats. Technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the award was established in 1969 and is now widely considered one of the Nobel prizes. The winners were announced Monday in Stockholm, capping a week of Nobel Prizes at a time when much of the world is experiencing the worst recession since World War II because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the AP reports. The discoveries of Milgrom and Wilson have benefited sellers, buyers, and taxpayers around the world, the prize committee said in a statement, per NBC News. In auction theory, researchers undertake a complicated analysis to try to figure out what the outcomes will be in an environment with differing bidding rules. Wilson is being recognized for his development of auction theory involving objects with a common value â€”a value that's uncertain beforehand but, in the end, is the same for everyone, such as the future value of minerals in a particular area. Using this theory, he illustrated why bidders afraid of the winner's curse â€”paying too muchâ€”will tend to bid less than what they think the common value is. Milgrom developed auction theory that also involved private values, which differ among bidders. He showed that when bidders know more about other bidders' estimated values, the seller tends to receive higher expected revenue. NBC notes that, of the 84 winners of the Nobel in Economics since its inception, only two have been women.",2 Stanford Profs Win Nobel Prize in Economics

The group collected the names by comparing death records from the past decade to voter rolls; it says the figure would have been bigger had the group had access to death records in neighboring states. But the group isn't prepared to release a figure of how many instances of voter fraud may have resulted from those names. The Charlotte Observer notes that in many cases, an apparent vote by a dead person is just an administrative error; for instance, a man with the same name as his father might end up voting as the deceased elder man. As for why the dead remain on this list, an elections official explains that people's names can slip through the cracks when addresses on voter rolls don't match those on death records, or when women change their names after marriage. Unless there is an exact match, we do not remove people from the voter rolls. He adds that the group's claims will be investigated.

He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in a trial that will focus on whether legally he can be found an accessory to murder for his actions. Groening is accused of helping operate the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland between May and June 1944, when some 425,000 Jews from Hungary were brought there and at least 300,000 almost immediately gassed to death. His job was to deal with the belongings stolen from victims. Prosecutors allege among other things that he was charged with helping collect and tally money that was found, which has earned him the moniker the accountant of Auschwitz from the German media. Groening's trial is the first to test a line of German legal reasoning opened by the 2011 trial of former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk on allegations he was a Sobibor death camp guard, which has unleashed an 11th-hour wave of new investigations of Nazi war crimes suspects. Prosecutors argue that anyone who was a death camp guard can be charged as an accessory to murders committed there, even without evidence of involvement in a specific death.

But that's exactly what a 2013 letter from the FDA to Pennsylvania's Castle Cheese Inc. stated, per BuzzFeedâ€”and an investigation by Bloomberg shows that's just the edge of the cheese wheel. After the FDA discovered that Castle was cramming its Parmesan cheese with lower-quality substitutes (e.g., Swiss, mozzarella, white cheddar) and cellulose (a filler made out of wood pulp that's legal in small amounts), then distributing it to grocery chains nationwide, Bloomberg decided to pick up some store-bought grated cheese and have it tested by an independent lab. And the results showed many supermarkets' Parmesan cheese suffered from the same issue. Although a food technologist for the Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research says cellulose is permitted as a cheese filler as long as it doesn't exceed 4% of the final product, a Walmart grated Parm came in at 7.8% cellulose, while a Jewel-Osco version registered at 8.8%.

The damage to the surveillance plane is being estimated at more than $62 million. The incident happened April 30 in Nebraska, and on Tuesday the Omaha World-Herald published the Air Force's findings on the fire following a successful Freedom of Information Act request.

During its investigation into the incident, the Air Force found only one of the 11 nuts in the plane's oxygen system had been properly tightened, the World-Herald reports. Furthermore, the oxygen system had been cobbled together with parts that were old, of poor quality, and sometimes even the wrong size.

A new study in the Lancet finds that of the 1.1 million such deaths in 2013, 965,000 of them were a direct result of being born too early, with the child dying within 28 days of birth. But another 125,000 deaths happened between the age of 1 month and 5 years, according to a press release. Meanwhile, the overall mortality rate for children under 5 has declined since 2000, as vaccines, antibiotics, and other advances have reduced deaths from pneumonia, measles, and other causes. The success we've seen in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases demonstrates that we can also be successful if we invest in prevention and care for preterm birth, says a researcher. The first step, which is already underway with $250 million in new funding: Figure out what causes preterm births. Obesity, high blood pressure, and later-in-life motherhood are all risk factors, but the exact trigger for premature labor remains a mystery, the Telegraph reports. The countries most affected are often poor: India has the highest number of deaths from preterm birth complications, followed by Nigeria and Pakistan. But even in the US, 28% of under-5 deaths are caused by such complications, which is above the global average of 17.4%; the US has one of the worst preterm birth rates of any high-resource country, the press release notes.

She died a slave at 60, hours before the war to end slavery unofficially came to a close. Or maybe not: A century and a half later, Reynolds' story is being rewritten. Newly discovered records show that she lingered for several daysâ€”long enough to have died a free woman. This new historical narrative has made Reynolds one of the central figures in commemorative activities marking Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia, starting today. Friday night, a eulogy will be delivered over a plain wooden coffin representing Reynolds' remains, and 4,600 candles will be lit to represent the slaves in Appomattox County who were emancipated by Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses Grant. Genealogist Alfred L. Jones III says the Reynolds story was hidden in plain sight. Reynolds was left by her masters, Dr. Samuel Coleman and his wife, Amanda Abbitt Coleman, in their home as Union and Confederate armies headed to the fateful battle, the final one before Lee's Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9, 1865. During the fighting, a Union cannonball blasted through the house, striking Reynolds and leaving a horrific wound in her arm. Jones worked for months seeking out the thin paper trail left by Reynolds. The breakthrough was finding Reynolds listed on a death registry in a public library in Lynchburg.

Roger was convicted in 1987 of murdering a man for his car and was put to death in Oklahoma at age 39; Rodney was convicted of beating a South Dakota prison guard to death with a pipe while he tried to escape in 2003. At the time, he was serving a life sentence for attempted murder and kidnapping. His execution is scheduled for September, but will likely be delayed for a mandatory review, the AP reports. While the Bergets are not the first siblings to be sentenced to death, the other three cases uncovered by the AP involve brothers who conspired together, while the Bergets' crimes were committed miles and decades apart.

Now, the company is becoming the first national pet chain to halt sales of all dog and cat treats made in China, NBC News reports. We know the FDA hasnâ€™t yet identified a direct cause for the reported illnesses, but we decided the uncertainty of the situation outweighs the lack of actual proof, says CEO Jim Myers. The deaths have been a matter of concern for years, and the FDA recently released startling new figures: Jerky treats have been associated with 1,000 dog deaths and almost 5,000 illnesses in dogs and cats, along with three human illnesses. Two of the humans were toddlers putting unusual items in their mouths, while one was an adult who apparently ate dog treats; why he or she did so isn't clear, Modern Farmer notes.

Foosâ€”who sold the motel in 1995â€”wanted to be seen as a sex researcher and social observer, not a mere Peeping Tom and pervert, according to the Denver Post. To that end, Foos kept detailed notes of everything he witnessed through his fake ceiling vents. For example, in 1973 he catalogued 184 male orgasms and 33 female orgasms, and noted that white heterosexuals tended to have missionary sex and that only 3% of his guests failed to have sex.

And anyway, the New York Times reports, polls usually show voters soon return to where they were. But President Trump has received a bounce this time that he can bask in: Two polls taken as the Republican National Convention ended show Joe Biden's lead at 6 percentage points, the smallest it's been in two months. A Yahoo News-YouGov poll measured the shift by contacting the same people it polled in late July. The new poll found Biden ahead 47%-41%, down from a 9-point lead the month before, Yahoo News reports. Trump's strength ratings may have driven his improvement. Before the convention, 33% attributed the quality to Trump, while 38% did afterward. Still, the president didn't pick up support from those looking for a law and order candidate. A Morning Consult poll taken Friday found a similar gap, with Biden on top 50%-40%. That was 4 points better than Trump polled last weekend. Biden had no comparable bump after the Democratic National Convention, per Morning Consult; Trump did have a bounce in 2016. But because fewer voters are undecided this time, polls show Biden in better shape now than Hillary Clinton was then. Trump has been hammering voters with warnings about suburban life, and he did narrow that gap to 6 points; Biden now leads among 50-42 among suburban voters. The GOP convention didn't improve Trump's likability ratings, though it did hurt Biden's. As before, 55% view the president unfavorably and 43% favorably. Biden fell from 51% to a 49% favorability rating after the Republican convention. (GOP convention showed who owns the party now.)",2 Polls Show RNC Cut Into Biden's Lead

They got their name from the Germans, who likened what the New York Times calls the whooshing of their planes to the sound a witch's broomstick might make; the Washington Post explains they killed their engines right before unloading their bombs to up the surprise factor. And they were good at what they did, so much so that Germans spewed rumors that the women relied on pills and injections that gave them cat-like night vision.

Major drops were also seen in Russia (8%) and the Ukraine (17%). In terms of specific alcohols, rum and vodka had the worst 2015. Not even beer was safe, as consumption dropped 1.3%. But it wasn't all bad news. People actually drank more English gin, Irish and Japanese whiskey, and dark beer last year. And cider consumption rose 4.5%.

The number of new sentences is the lowest in the 40 years that the center calls the modern death-penalty era. Since executions resumed in 1977 following a halt imposed by the Supreme Court, the number of executions peaked at 98 in 1999; that same year, 277 inmates were sentenced to death. Problematic executions in Arizona, Ohio, and Oklahoma and questions about drugs used in lethal injection executions have contributed to public outcry and delays in carrying out death sentences, says Richard Dieter, the center's executive director. Exonerations of people who were wrongly convicted, the availability of prison terms of life without parole, and the cost of capital trials and the appeals process also are factors in the persistent decline, Dieter says. Just three statesâ€”Texas, Missouri, and Floridaâ€”accounted for 28 executions, or 80% of the total. The only other states that carried out executions in 2014 were Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, and Oklahoma. When almost all of the executions are in so few of the states, you have to question the relevancy of the death penalty in the country as a whole. If we were seeking deterrence or retribution, a lot more states would be doing this, Dieter says.",Executions Hit Lowest Number in 20 Years

And by anecdotal accounts pouring in since the workers at the Svartedalens home in Gothenburg switched from their eight-hour shifts in February, employees are enjoying a better quality of life, which ups their well-being and allows them to take better care of their elderly patients, their families, and themselves. I used to be exhausted all the time, one nurse tells the paper. I would come home from work and pass out on the sofa.

While interning at Keele University two years ago, the then-15-year-old found what looked to be a planet; telescopes in Chile were used to take a deeper look, and now astronomers in Switzerland and Belgium have confirmed his find. Specifically, Tom discovered an exoplanet the size of Jupiter in the constellation Hydra some 1,000 light years away. And he did it right out the gate: It was just my third day when I spotted what looked a good candidate, but I had already gone through more than 1,000 sets of data by then, Tom tells the BBC. It looks boring, but when you think about what you're actually doing it's amazing really. The BBC explains Tom didn't make the find via telescope, but rather, by poring over data collected by the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP). He was looking for dips in brightness that might indicate a planet passing in front of its star. The one he spotted has for now been called WASP-142bâ€”so-called because it's the 142nd planet found by the UK-led WASP, reports Gizmodo. A competition has been established to settle on a name, and Tom says he plans to submit a contender.

Elene Cowan gave birth to her fraternal twin boys nearly six weeks apart, and after 100 days in the neonatal intensive care unit, the boys, now 4 and 6 months old, are home, weighing in at more than 9 pounds a piece, and expected to do fine. Cowan learned her amniotic sac was bulging in the birth canal at 24 weeks; with doctors unable to halt her labor, she delivered son Carl on Jan. 20; he weighed one pound four ouncesâ€”so tiny his mother could slide her engagement ring up his arm. Cowan's doctor tells KOBI he believes an incompetent cervix may have been behind the premature birth; he literally stitched her cervix shut and used medication and a special balloon to keep Carl's brother, David, inside in the hopes of improving his own chance of survival. Cowan spent the next six weeks on bed rest, moving only to visit Carl.

Conducted in March, the network's third Millionaire Survey of 750 Americans with a net worth of at least $1 million shows 84% believe they belong to the middle or upper middle class, though they actually represent the richest 10% of Americans. Some 44% of respondents said they were middle class, 40% said they were upper middle class, and just 5% said they were upper class. In total, only about 4% of those millionaires said they considered themselves to be wealthy. Respondents worth $5 million or more didn't feel much differently: About 72% identified as middle class or upper middle class, and only 11% admitted they were rich. This apparent denial could stem from the fact that many self-made millionaires started out in the middle class and still favor middle-class values of hard work and family. Experts add there's also a widening gap between the wealthy and the mega-rich. Curious about whom millionaires like politically?

The BBC and Telegraph report body parts littered the ground near the Erawan Shrine, where at least 12 people were killedâ€”foreign tourists possibly among themâ€”and 78 were injured. All I can say now is there has been an explosion in central Bangkok involving a motorcycle bomb, a police rep tells Reuters. Another adds, There could be another explosion, so we have blocked off the crime scene and are asking bystanders to move back. A BBC correspondent says burnt motorbikes were seen near the blast site. No person or group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, though the country's defense minister claims the perpetrators intended to destroy the economy and tourism because the incident occurred in the heart of the tourism district. Police say they were searching for two or three other bombs; the Bangkok Post reports via Twitter that police have safely detonated at least one other bomb in the Ratchaprasong area, which also includes three shopping malls and a five-star hotel. The Telegraph reports two small blasts near the entrance of one of those malls left one person hurt back in February.

Vulcan Inc. confirmed Sunday that a team searching for sunken warships from the Battle of Midway had found the wreck of the Akagi, one of four aircraft carriers that Japan lost in the battle 77 years ago. Another, the Kaga, was discovered last week by the Petrel vessel. More than a thousand Japanese crewmen died on the two ships. Some 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans died in the battle.The team says the Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet of water, ABC reports. The team has been conducting grid searches around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands searching for wrecks from the June 1942 battle. The Akagi and the Kaga both took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor, which occurred just six months before the Battle of Midway. Japan had aimed to lure American warships into an ambush at Midway and inflict devastating damage on the US Pacific Fleet, but they were defeated after the US cracked Japan's code and prepared an ambush of its own. Rob Kraft, director of undersea operations on the Petrel, tells the AP that the search for sunken World War II ships started with late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's wish to honor his father's military service. It really extends beyond that at this time, Kraft says. We're honoring today's service members, it's about education and ... bringing history back to life for future generations.

The existence of pentaquarks was first proposed in the 1960s by American physicists Georg Zweig and Murray Gell-Mann, who coined the term quark. CERN likened previous attempts to prove the existence of pentaquarks to looking for silhouettes in the dark, whereas LHCb conducted the search with the lights on, and from all angles. A very scientific statement from Guy Wilkinson, a rep for the LHCb experiment team per the BBC: The pentaquark is not just any new particle ... It represents a way to aggregate quarks, namely the fundamental constituents of ordinary protons and neutrons, in a pattern that has never been observed before in over fifty years of experimental searches. Studying its properties may allow us to understand better how ordinary matter, the protons and neutrons from which we're all made, is constituted.

In the next 12 to 15 hours, downtown Midland could be under approximately 9 feet of water, Whitmer said at the presser, per Reuters. We are anticipating an historic high water level. The National Weather Service is calling the situation an extremely dangerous one, per the BBC. In a release, Whitmer implored residents to go stay with loved ones elsewhere in the state or head to a shelter. The AP notes the Edenville Dam, built in 1924, received an unsatisfactory rating in 2018 from the state; the Sanford Dam, built a year later, received a fair rating. Midland County official Mark Bone tells CNN about 10,000 people had been evacuated as of early Wednesday, leading to another dilemma: how to house locals in the county's shelters while adhering to social distancing guidelines brought by the coronavirus. He says masks are being made available to everyone coming in to the shelters. People are also having their temperatures taken, and emergency responders are wearing personal protective equipment. To go through this in the midst of a global pandemic is almost unthinkable, Whitmer said, adding that the state's National Guard has also been activated to respond to the emergency situation. But ... to the best of our ability we are going to navigate this together.","After 2 Dams Fail, Mich. Gov. Warns of 9 Feet of Water"

Turns out it didn't save taxpayers any money, didn't affect the number of applications, and didn't even ferret out very many drug users, the New York Times reports. During the four months the tests were given, just 2.6% of applicants failed, mostly for marijuana use. Everyone who passed was reimbursed for the cost of the testâ€”which totaled $118,140, or more than the state would have paid in benefits to those who failed, according to an ACLU director. That means the program actually cost the government $45,780. The tests were only given from July through October; at that point, following an ACLU lawsuit against the state, a judge issued a temporary injunction halting the tests. The recently released state data comes on the heels of Georgia installing a practically identical law and other states considering doing the same. Of course, supporters of the Florida law still back it, and some insist that the law will deter drug users who would normally apply for assistance.

Eddie Harrison died yesterday in a hospital after suffering from influenza, said Rebecca Wright, who was caring for the couple in their home in Alexandria, Va. Harrison became distressed after his wife and longtime companion, 96-year-old Edith Hill, was taken away, said Wright, who is Hill's daughter. He lived for her, and she lived for him. It's the love story of the century, Wright said, recalling how they would dance, take walks, and care for each other. Their marriage this year after 10 years together was disputed in court. Their wedding was problematic because Hill has been declared legally incapacitated for several years. Another of Hill's daughters, Patricia Barber, contested the marriage, saying it would complicate Hill's estate. But Hill and Harrison wanted to stay together. A judge appointed a new guardian for Hill to protect her interests, removing Barber and Wright as guardians, but left the marriage intact. The interracial aspect of the marriage also was unique because the two longtime Virginians would not have been allowed to marry if they had met in their 20s, 30s, or 40s under state law. On Dec. 6, Hill's guardian arrived to take Hill away to Barber's home in Florida for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation.

Michael Taylor is not just capable of fleeing while on bondâ€”he is an expert in the subject, prosecutors said in a court filing, per Bloomberg. The plot to spirit Ghosn out of Japan was one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history, involving a dizzying array of hotel meetups, bullet train travel, fake personas, and the chartering of a private jet. The two men are wanted by Japanese officials. Michael Taylor, 59, and Peter Taylor, his 27-year-old son, were arrested Wednesday morning by the US Marshals Service Special Operations Group, NBC News reports. Prosecutors said the younger Taylor had been planning to take a flight Wednesday from Boston to Beirut, where Ghosn has been holed up since he jumped bail in Japan. According to court papers, Michael Taylor and another suspect, George-Antoine Zayek, allegedly exploited an airport security flaw and smuggled Ghosn onto a plane in a box meant for concert equipment last December, the AP reports. Peter Taylor allegedly met with Ghosn seven times in the months before the escape.",2 Americans Arrested Over Ghosn Escape

It goes like this: Paul doesn't get the party nomination and exacts his revenge by launching a third-party run on the Libertarian ticket that siphons votes from the Republican nominee and gives President Obama another four years. Maybe, but Kornacki suggests one very important reason Paul might not go that route: His senator son, Rand. If the Paul name were to turn into the Republican equivalent of Nader, the fallout could threaten the inroads that Rand has made and his otherwise bright future in the party, writes Kornacki. The Pauls' libertarian views are no longer so far out of the mainstream, and it's not inconceivable that Rand could launch a successful run of his own in 2016 or 2020. This offers Ron Paul a different, more meaningful way of enjoying the last laugh in his war with the party establishment: Stepping aside gracefully at the end of the GOP primary campaign and handing off the family political franchise to his son.

Accusations of shady dealings have followed the Russian leader since the earliest days of his political career, and some officials believe he has salted away huge wealth through secret holdings in energy firms.

Putin himself, who reported income of just $102,000 last year, has dismissed rumors of hidden wealth. Just gossip thatâ€™s not worth discussing. Itâ€™s simply rubbish, he told reporters in 2008.

Dr. Anurag Bishnoi tells the Guardian he was at first hesitant to perform the IVF procedure for Daljinder Kaur and her 79-year-old husband at his clinic in Hisar, but went ahead when tests showed Kaur was in good health. She gave birth to a baby boy on April 19 using a donor egg and is believed to be the world's oldest mother, per the Telegraph. Reproduction is a fundamental right, says Bishnoi, who claims to have also helped a 70-year-old give birth. Others aren't so sure. IVF treatments are relatively inexpensive and largely unregulated in Indiaâ€”the Indian Council of Medical Registry recommends limiting the combined age of a couple receiving IVF to 100 years, per the Times of Indiaâ€”but doctors hope a bill will be passed within six months banning fertility treatment for women 50 and above. Such legislation has actually been pending for seven years. The head of India's federation of gynecologists calls Bishnoi a rogue doctor who needs to be banned ; the Telegraph notes Bishnoi's website features other elderly success stories. Just because we can do something doesnâ€™t mean we should do it, just to make world records, another doctor tells the Guardian. Kaur's sonâ€”born 4.4 poundsâ€” is going to be an orphan in a few years. And there are serious risks for the mother involving cardiac and bone issues. Bishnoi, however, says the couple have relatives who are ready to help take care of the baby when his parents die. Everyone asked me to adopt a baby but I never wanted to. Now I have my own child, Kaur says. We will raise him and give him a proper education. (This 65-year-old set a record when she gave birth.)",Doctor Defends Decision to Help 72-Year-Old Give Birth

The Earth itself, after all, is 4.5 billion years old, the Sydney Morning Herald notes. Nothing in science goes without being questioned, geochemist John Valley tells NPR. Now, however, his team has proven the crystals' age is correctâ€”in other words, they're the oldest Earth-formed materials ever found. Researchers dated the crystals, which need magnification to be seen, by investigating how much of the uranium within them had turned into lead. But that standard dating method wasn't enough to convince some fellow scientists. Doubters pointed out that as time went by, lead atoms could have shifted around inside the crystal, potentially resulting in inaccurate readings. So the experts turned to a process called atom-probe tomography, which allowed them to map out specific atoms, NPR reports. The study showed that, in fact, the atoms hadn't moved much. Now, we've proved that the chemical record inside these zircons is trustworthy, Valley tells LiveScience. The findings indicate that the Earth may have been able to host life earlier than had been believed: there is no reason why life could not have existed on Earth 4.3 billion years ago, Valley says.",Earth's Oldest Rocks: 4.4B-Year-Old Crystals

Of course, Taco Bell ultimately came out with just that roughly 17 years later, and its insanely successful line of Doritos Locos Tacos has netted the firm more than $1 billion in sales. Andrea Watt, one of the former interns, tells the Huffington Post she doesn't want money ( Iâ€™m sure I signed away that anything I pitched to them was their property anyway ), but she wouldn't mind at least some creditâ€”for an idea that she recalls being told wasn't really that marketable. The Huffington Post has all sorts of proof of their idea, including promotional materials the team created. They suggested calling the product Dorito Tacos, charging 79 cents, and having Matthew Perry shill for the item. Another team member, Mark Rader, adds that the two flavors the team pitchedâ€”Nacho Cheese and Cool Ranchâ€”ended up being the first two flavors offered by Taco Bell. A former account supervisor for the ad agency at the time says the client certainly saw all the pitches. But others have claimed to be the brains behind the taco, including a man whose 2013 obit widely touted him as having pitched the idea to Frito Lay in 2009, and a former prison inmate who's actually suing over the matter; he claims a mystery person stole a letter containing the idea from the USPS and gave it to Taco Bell.

Early this month she called off that fast, but she fell into a coma two days later and died of cardiac arrest on Oct. 4â€”and now her parents, well-off jewelers in Hyderabad, and other family members have been charged with homicide, cops tell AFP. Aradhana Samdariya's relatives insist she chose to embark on the 68-day fast of her own volition as part of a ritual in Jainism, an ancient Indian religion that believes the way to liberation and bliss is to live lives of harmlessness and renunciation and whose foundation lies in the concern for the welfare of every being in the universe. But others, including the children's rights group that filed the complaint against Aradhana's family, say the young teen was coerced, perhaps in the misguided belief it would make her father's business more profitable. Aradhana's grandfather notes it's not the first time the girl had fasted: He says she had pulled off an eight-day fast and a 34-day fast, and so was determined to go even longer this time, partly because she was interested in becoming a nun, per the Deccan Chronicle. But a local NGO says the dad's business was faltering and the family's guru suggested having Aradhana fast for good luck. The BBC and AFP note she lived on nothing but boiled water during her fast, while others, such as Firstpost.com, say not even sips of water are permitted during the most extreme version of Jain fasting. Psychologists say that children are especially vulnerable to the guilt that may lure them into such dangerous practices.

Marine animal corpses that wash ashore are widely regarded as the tip of the iceberg, notes the NRDC, and new research shows that that iceberg is likely vastâ€”that the real carnage is likely 50 times greater. The Conservation Letters study used five years of stranding data for 14 different Gulf species and measured that against known population sizes and survival rates. The results vary widely by speciesâ€”one in 30 dead sperm whales are thought to wash ashore, while that number is one in 200 for a striped or spinner dolphin.

The AG's office says Manhattan restaurant Per Se, which charges $310 for its tasting menu, slapped a 20% service charge on the bills of private-dining client customers and, in violation of state law, used that money for general operational costs instead of giving it directly to the servers, the New York Daily News reports. The restaurant was also fined $100,000 and will be required to step up compliance with labor laws, reports the New York Times. The settlement ensures that servers will not continue to be cheated out of their hard-earned tipsâ€”tips that customers intended for them, Schneiderman said. In a statement to CNBC, the restaurant says the failure to pay the charge to servers was an oversight after state regulations on service charges changed in 2011. Per Se says workers were never short-changed and no monies intended for employees were withheld, and the charge helped pay for industry-leading wages that average $116,000 a year for a waiter, including overtime and tips.

Though it initially wasn't clear how many people were on board the C-130B Hercules, officials now say it was carrying 122 passengersâ€”including maybe five to eight children, an official tells the Guardianâ€”and 12 crew, meaning several were killed on the ground. Not all those on board were military personnel or relatives, who can fly with special permission. A woman tells Reuters her brother, a civilian, bought a ticket for the flight from Medan to the Riau Islands. The air force chief says no one should have been asked to pay. What we fear is that there may be certain people offering to take passengers on board without permission, that is what we are investigating, he says. Meanwhile, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has called for a thorough investigation after smoke was seen billowing from the plane before the crash. He also promises an evaluation of the age of planes and defense systems in the country, adding, Hopefully, we can stay away from disasters. Vice President Jusuf Kalla tells the Jakarta Post the plane was an old aircraft, already 50 years, but it was about to undergo a retrofit. It was built in the US in 1964. This incident shows us that we must renew our aircraft and our military equipment, adds a lawmaker and member of the parliamentary commission for defense. As parliament we will support giving more funding to the military so that they can upgrade.

The kicker: So far, he hasn't been able to evict the two official tenants, Burak Firik and Dogan Kimilli, WPIX reports. Landlord Eddie Shiew owns a three-story Queens home, and the person renting out the first floor alerted him to construction on the third floor. Shiew found that a construction crew had divided each bedroom into three bedrooms by putting up sheetrock. WPIX also investigated, and found people staying in the apartment who said they were paying $35 a night for a room after finding the property on Airbnb. Shiew brought in his own workmen to tear down the sheetrock dividers; he also changed the locks and told Firik and Kimilli to get out. But they went to court and got a court order against me, Shiew says. They said I illegally locked them out. The court agreed, ordering Shiew to let them back in. This time, instead of putting up sheetrock, the tenants allegedly used curtains as room dividers and continued to rent out rooms on Airbnb. Meanwhile, Shiew hired a lawyer and started eviction proceedings. He points out that the lease they signed bars them from making repairs or alterations, and his lawyer thinks the court will order them out within months. As Gothamist points out, Airbnb released anonymized data on their hosts last week to rebut allegations that many New York hosts are basically running illegal hostels, and said that just two Queens hosts had six or more listings on the site. Still, as Firik and Kimilli's case proves, it's exceedingly difficult to evict tenants running Airbnb hotels, adds the post.

Thatâ€™s a median of $170,494 versus $3,662. In 1984, that gap was $120,457 versus $11,521â€”a 10-to-one ratioâ€”but between 1984 and 2009, wealth was rising for households headed by older adults while falling for households headed by younger adults. Though an age gap is to be expected, since wealth typically increases as people age, this gap is the largest in the 25 years the government has collected these data. Why? The housing bubble is a big reasonâ€”as home equity has increased for many older households that bought before the bubble, it has decreased for many younger ones that bought during its height. Rising college loan debt is another factor, as is employment: Younger people have been entering the labor market later in life, while older people have simultaneously continued to work until later in life.

If the ban does indeed happen, Norway would become the first country in the world to only allow the sale of electric vehicles. If a country is going to switch to all-electric, it makes sense for Norway to be the one to do it. CNBC reports only 150,000 cars or so were sold in Norway last year. That's one of the smallest amounts in Europe. And 24% of cars sold in Norway are electric already, the highest percentage in the world. Itâ€™s less of a leap for Norway than any other country, but itâ€™s still a big step, Electek states. Ironically, Norway is also one of the biggest exporters of oil in the world.

Four of the blasts occurred over four hours in locations from a busy fish market to a crowded bus station, said Police Commissioner Clement Adoda. The fifth explosion from a car bomb at a military checkpoint 50 miles outside the city wounded a soldier and two members of a civilian self-defense unit. The bomber apparently wanted to reach Maiduguri. In the deadliest blast, 18 people died when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a tricycle taxi at the entrance to the bustling Baga fish market, police said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bear the hallmarks of the Boko Haram extremist group. Maiduguri is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the extremists have made it the target for many bombings since they were driven from their base there after a military state of emergency was declared in May 2013. Boko Haram has increased suicide bombings and village attacks in recent weeks as forces from Nigeria and Chad have driven the insurgents from a score of towns along Nigeria's border with Cameroon.","5 Separate Suicide Attacks Kill 54, Injure 143 in Nigeria"

Under the deal, favored by the ruling Labor Party and meant to deter human smuggling, Australia would send 800 newly arrived refugees to Malaysia to be processed and have their claims investigated. In return, over a period of four years, Australia would receive 4,000 asylum seekers who are recognized by the UN as genuine refugees.

That's the message from a chief prosecutor in Indiana who helped send three people to prison for a scheme that defrauded Amazon of $1.2 million. US Attorney Josh Minkler says married couple Erin and Leah Finan stole more than 2,700 electronics items from Amazon, including Apple MacBooks, Samsung smartwatches, and GoPro cameras, by demanding free replacements for products they wrongly claimed as faulty. The 38-year-olds used hundreds of false identities to order and pick up items at locations across the state, netting $750,000 between 2014 and 2016, reports USA Today. Danijel Glumac benefited, too. Police say the 29-year-old accomplice made $500,000 selling the stolen goods for a profit to a buyer in New York. The buyer then raised prices again before offering the products for sale to the public, including on Amazon, per MarketWatch. Consumer fraud not only unjustly enriches the perpetrator, it causes all of us to pay higher retail prices, Minkler said Monday in announcing sentences for the accused, all three of whom accepted guilty pleas and must pay $1.2 million in restitution. Glumac, of Indianapolis, was sentenced to two years in prison for money laundering and fencing stolen products. The Finans, from the Muncie-Anderson area, were sentenced to just under six years (71 months and 68 months, respectively) for federal mail fraud and money laundering, though prosecutors said they also considered that the pair had bounced checks, rented houses and cars without paying, and sold stolen sports equipment on Facebook, per a release.","In 2 Years, Trio Stole $1.2M From Amazon"

TRAIN_1_1830,"(Oct 11, 2015 7:59 AM CDT) For just the third time in 40 years, millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans, and federal retirees can expect no increase in benefits next year, unwelcome news for more than one-fifth of the nation's population. They can blame low gas prices. By law, the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, is based on a government measure of inflation, which is being dragged down by lower prices at the pump. The government is scheduled to announce the COLAâ€”or lack of oneâ€”on Thursday, when it releases the Consumer Price Index for September. Inflation has been so low this year that economists say there is little chance the September numbers will produce a benefit increase for next year. Prices actually have dropped from a year ago, according to the inflation measure used for the COLA. It's a very high probability that it will be zero, says an economist. Other pricesâ€”other than energyâ€”would have to jump. It would have to be a very sizable increase that would be visible, and I don't think that's happened. Congress enacted automatic increases for Social Security beneficiaries in 1975, when inflation was high and there was a lot of pressure to regularly raise benefits. Since, increases have averaged 4% a year. Only twice before, in 2010 and 2011, have there been no increases. COLA affects 70 million Americans. Medicare beneficiaries are also on the hook for a premium increase, including 2.8 million new beneficiaries, 1.6 million whose premiums aren't deducted from their Social Security payments, and 3.1 million people with higher incomes. Their premiums could jump by about $54 a month; more for those with higher incomes. All beneficiaries would see their Part B annual deductible for outpatient care jump by $76, to an estimated $223. The numbers for July and August show that, overall, consumer prices have fallen since last year. Fuel prices are down by 23% from a year ago, but prices for other goods and services, such as health care and housing, are up. They have a formula that they use that doesn't reflect the actual cost of living, complains one retiree.

It's not clear how they learned of her, though the BBC reports that she alerted the British Consulate in Jeddah to her situation. Her lawyers say it has been difficult to communicate with her.

Mohammed Al-Jeffery disputes his daughter's claims; he says he took her to Saudi Arabia to save her life, and that he fear[s] she will go back to her old destructive lifestyle if she is returned to the UK.

Lion Country Safari in Loxahatchee says 10-year-old female Lily and Jioni, a 1-year-old male, were killed instantly by lightning during a storm early last month. The older giraffe was between 14 and 16 feet tall. The park says there are numerous shelters in the habitat that the giraffes can access during a storm if they choose to use them, but they can't force the animals into them. It's like a billion-to-one chance this happened to us and our poor giraffes, park spokeswoman Haley Passeser tells NBC. Authorities say they're not sure whether the two giraffes, who weren't related, were killed by single lightning strike or two separate strikes. The drive-through safari park has 16 remaining giraffes. We do try to provide them a lot of choice, Passeser says. If they don't choose to seek shelter, there isn't a lot we can do to encourage them to. The park, which has a lightning detection system, says it is reviewing safety procedures.

We are told we are the new generation of American women; no longer a minority, we are, in fact, the majority of breadwinners in American homes. And yet the best we can get is the flamenco.

The team has created 13 emojis of male and female farmers, chefs, doctors, scientists, and more and submitted them to the Unicode Consortium, which oversees emoji creation, reports BuzzFeed. The proposed emojis are actually created by combining existing icons, notes Gizmodo. To get the female scientist emoji, for example, you'd pair the woman and microscope emojis, while a woman and a fried egg would make a female chef. We believe we can have a larger positive impact by adding 13 new emoji that depict women across a representative sample of professions, the Google team writes in the proposal, per the Verge.

Alexander Hughes, 17, who was driving the truck, was hospitalized in critical condition. A third passenger was hospitalized and released.

The study sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that between 2007 and 2012, the estimated total cut in food product calories from a group of 16 major food companies was in the range of 6.4 trillion. Seventy-eight calories would be about the same as an average cookie or a medium apple, and the federal government estimates an average daily diet at around 2,000 calories. The study said the calories cut averaged out to 78 calories per day for the entire US population. The 2010 pledge taken by the companiesâ€”including General Mills, Campbell Soup, ConAgra Foods, Kraft Foods, Kellogg, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Hersheyâ€”was to cut 1 trillion calories by 2012 and 1.5 trillion calories by 2015. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation signed on to hold the companies accountable, and that group hired researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to painstakingly count the calories in almost every single packaged item in the grocery store. To meet the commitment, the companies took a variety of approaches.

Customers' biggest concern about pickup trucks is their gas mileage, executive chairman Bill Ford tells the New York Times. With the aluminum version some 700 pounds lighter than previous models, the F-150 will see its mileage improve by 5% to 15%, Ford says.

Kappell hasn't wavered from his insistence that what he said on air was an unintentional linguistic error from speaking too quickly and that WHEC fired him prior to conducting any real investigation into the situation. He also says in his suit that Warren publicly said Kappell's use of the racial term was intentional and that the defendants have caused him great pain and anguish, marred his reputation, and hurt his career. Because of [Warren's] actions, my family and I have suffered greatly these past many months and unfortunately she has taken zero responsibility and has shown no willingness to move towards a resolution.

Half of it was paid in May, listed as an itemized disbursement. That and the other half, listed as debts and obligations, appear on a June 20 filing.

Whatâ€™s really troubling is that the Academy missed out on a chance to do something it hasnâ€™t done in more than 50 years and has really only done once: honor a film with a black protagonist that is not about the Black Struggle. She's writing about Creed, which was almost entirely ignored by the Academy when the nominations were announced Thursday. Itâ€™s frustrating because the movie is entertaining, exciting, terrifically directed and actedâ€”and if an overindulgent, hollow frontier film [The Revenant] can get nominated, Creed most certainly deserves to be there, too. The only nomination secured by Creed, which has a black star and black writer/director, was for its white co-star. In the five decades since Lilies of the Fieldâ€”starring Sidney Poitier as a drifter who helps some German nunsâ€”was nominated for best picture, Harris has a hard time thinking of any other films with a black protagonist that were so honoredâ€”unless they were about racial oppression. Most such films are about black people in relation to white people, while their nominations hinge on how they make white people feelâ€”guilty, sad, better about their own perceived views on race. Harris says this is indicative of the Academy's love affair with black history at the expense of black present. Iâ€™ve long tired of Hollywoodâ€™s vision of the struggle as the only marketable narrative for black folks. â€¦ The Academy doesnâ€™t know it yet, but Creed is clear proof: A story can be emotionally rich, powerful, and undeniably blackâ€”even if it doesnâ€™t center on injustice.

Condoms are cheap and effective, the foundation said in a statement, but they also decrease pleasure for men. Is it possible to develop a product without this stigma, or better, one that is felt to enhance pleasure? it asks.

From there, they'll have to show a clear testable hypothesis and data to move on to potential Phase II fundingâ€”which could net them as much as $1 million.

Over the past decade more than 1,500 Americans have died of acetaminophen overdose, or about 150 a year. But the FDA has repeatedly put off measures that might curb the problem, even though its own advisory committees have been urging increased safety measures since 1977. It blew its most recent deadline for new rules just last month. Too much acetaminophen can seriously damage the liver, so it's dangerous in too-large doses or when combined with alcohol. The margin between a safe acetaminophen dose and a dangerous one is unusually small, which has led several other countries to put limits on sales. But McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson & Johnson unit that makes Tylenol, has long battled against such measures in the US. To its credit, McNeil has also funded development on an antidote to acetaminophen poisoning, among other safety measures. At one point it tried and failed to create a safer acetaminophen alternative, but kept that research secret. The FDA, meanwhile, has placed a black box warning on prescription acetaminophen, warning that overdoses can cause death, but not on the over-the-counter version.

It's also a break from the don't touch nature of the museum world, providing an extraordinary opportunity to spend time completely alone with a work of art by a leading contemporary artist.

Christopher Cerk, 21, loaded the tiny house on a trailer and hauled it with him for the start of fall classes, the Ann Arbor News reported yesterday. Around freshman year I didn't enjoy living in the dorms so I wanted to do something different, Cerk says. I started researching different ways to live. I wanted to put all the money that would be going towards rent ... to something else. He spent $13,000 on materials and built the house over the past two years. He expects to save money over his last two years at Michigan, and has a place to live after graduation. It cost Cerk about $800 a month for rent last year. Cerk is not revealing the location because the small size could violate local rules. The house is on the trailer on a private lot. Cerk has the property owner's permission to keep it there. He also will get some water from the property owner's home. The house features a compostable toilet, shower, and two 100-watt solar panels that are expected to supply enough juice to charge his cellphone and laptop, provide lighting and power for a cook-top stove.

A report released yesterday by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics tracks the prevalence and the magnitude of bladder and bowel incontinence and finds nearly 51% all US seniors who live at home suffer from it. Some 44% reported urinary leakage, and 17% bowel leakage (some people experience both); 25% have moderate, severe, or very severe urinary cases, HealthDay News reports. Women are much more likely to suffer from it, due to loss of muscle control following childbirth and declining estrogen levels after menopause. In men, incontinence can be caused by prostate problems or nerve damage. The report also gathered data on incontinence among nursing home, residential care, and hospice facility residents (though it notes that different definitions of incontinence were used for the various populations). Nearly 76% percent of long-term nursing home residents couldn't completely control bladder or bowel function 14 days prior to the survey, the Washington Post adds. Experts hope the study will diminish the stigma attached to discussing the problem, which can be treated with diet, drugs, and surgery.

In fact, the NRA backed stricter sentencing and more prisons in a perfect storm of lobbying that Mother Jones says led to a larger and harsher culture of incarceration in America. It began when the NRA, cash-poor in the early 1990s, launched a program called CrimeStrike to promote its prison agenda. Our prisons are overcrowded, said LaPierre. Our bail laws are atrocious. We'll be the bad guy. NRA ads slammed President Clinton for cutting federal prison construction and offered a fix: Tell them you want a crime bill with $8 billion more to build prisons, or you don't want their crime bill at all! When the dust had settled, prison-construction money rose threefold federally and increased in states thanks in part to NRA funding. What's more, the NRA backed three-strikes laws that passed in Washington and California, leading to prison overcrowding, higher taxpayer bills, and talk of inhumane conditions.

But new research out of the University of Bristol suggests that to keep your good looks through others' eyes, it may be necessary to cut yourself off at one drink, LiveScience says. The study published in Alcohol and Alcoholism used an admittedly small sample size: 40 students who volunteered to throw a few back for science. But researchers found that participants who imbibed just one glass of wine were perceived to be more attractive by a separate group of raters than their previously sober selves or after they had had two drinks. Researchers took a photo of each participant before drinking, after one drink, and after two drinks (each subject was told to make a neutral facial expression in all three pictures). Scientists then asked the rating group to view each subject's sober photo first next to the one-drink photo, then next to the two-drink photo. In the former case, the one-drink photo was rated more attractive than the sober representation, while in the latter, the one-drink photo still won out over the two-drink pic. Researchers aren't sure why, but they speculate it could come down to pupil dilation (which they suggest makes a subject more appealing), the slight muscle relaxation that results from just one drink, or the bit of rosiness that occurs when you're tipsy but not necessarily drunk. That obviously doesn't mean that alcohol is healthy, the study's lead researcher says. What it means is that alcohol is sort of hijacking that mechanism, or promoting the aspects of facial features that we regard as attractive for other reasons.

At a third-grade party at Collingswood's William P. Tatem Elementary School, a student made a remark about brownies at the festivities, and another student said the comment was racist. The next thing everyone knew, the school had called the police, and the boy who made the comment was being interrogated by an officer, per the boy's mom.

The hubbub can be traced to a May meeting in which the Camden County Prosecutor's office ordered cops to step in whenever a possible crime is committed in the schools, the Courier-Post reports. That action was spurred by the failure of the district to report a previous allegation of criminal conduct, which is still being investigated and which the Collingswood police chief says wasn't an egregious matter.

So say University of Oxford conservation experts who've been tracking one of the continent's most photographed lions for seven years, reports NBC News. First Cecil's brothers are now at risk as rival male lions seek to take over the pride, which may lead to the overthrow of his weakened coalition, and subsequently the death of his cubs, says David MacDonald, the founding director of Oxford's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, which tracks lions. Cecil's death is a particular blow for MacDonald, who says his team watched him for hours, indeed weeks, months, and years. Cecil was simply a magnificent lion. In terms of what's next for Palmer, the US and Zimbabwe do have an extradition treaty, but the Department of Justice has only said that it is aware of the situation, reports Time. A US Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson says the service is deeply concerned about the killing and investigating further.

Grate reportedly told police he stabbed the unknown womanâ€”whose remains were discovered in 2007 but have yet to be identifiedâ€”because his mother ordered magazines from her that never arrived, per People and WOIO.

He didn't return it to the closet, but stashed it in the bottom of his top dresser drawer. The next morning, his 10-year-old son Sean went looking for the Nintendo games his mother had hidden and found the revolver instead. He picked it up, waved it around, pointed it at a window, and just as his frightened 8-year-old sister Erin ran out of the room, pulled the trigger. The bullet entered her heart. He held her, trying to staunch the blood, and watched her eyes roll back. ''Please don't die. Please, God. Please, don't be dead, Sean said in a 911 call, recounts the New York Times.

The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls clear and convincing evidence that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documentsâ€”including phone and Air Force recordsâ€”supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial.

And they were truly impressive monkeys indeed. The newly discovered Panamacebus transitus had to somehow cross the 100 miles of water that separated South America from North America prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama 3.5 million years ago. As far as scientists know, the monkey is the only mammal to cross the Miocene Central American Seaway into North America. We never would've predicted they would've been here, study co-author Jonathan Bloch tells Nature. While it's possible the monkeys swam to North America, it's more likely they inadvertently found themselves setting sail on rafts made of vegetation. Our current knowledge of Panamacebus transitus comes from seven fossilized teeth found at the site of the Panama Canal expansion, according to a press release. The teeth are 21 million years old and show the new monkey likely resembled a modern-day capuchin. There's no evidence Panamacebus transitus did well in its new Panamanian home; the ancestors of modern-day North American monkeys came millions of years later after the isthmus was formed. The Panama Canal expansion has been a boon for researchers. I asked my boss for a million dollars to dig a hole in the ground, says one of the study's authors.

The dispatcher stopped short of giving McKinley permission, but said, You have to do what you have to do to protect your baby. After 21 minutes, 24-year-old Justin Shane Martin made it inside, brandishing a 12-inch hunting knife, and McKinley promptly shot and killed him. She will not be charged since she was acting in self-defense, prosecutors say, but Martin's alleged accompliceâ€”who fled after hearing the gunshot and later turned himself inâ€”does face a first-degree murder charge. The two men were high on prescription painkillers and police say they may have been looking for more in McKinley's home, because they knew her husband had recently died from lung cancer. However, NewsOK paints an even more disturbing picture, noting that McKinley feared she was being watched for weeks, that someone may even have been entering her home, and that her dogs may have been poisoned in the days after her husband entered the hospital. She'd had previous run-ins with Martin: Her mother says he had followed her at a rodeo two years ago, and she had also run into him at a convenience store recently, CBS News reports.

This is a very important and positive day in the history of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, said the club's chief executive, who'd taken some heat for previously saying single-sex clubs are just kind of, for some people, a way of life that they rather like. Founded back in 1754, the club was originally granted access to play on the land as long as the then-Archbishop of St. Andrews would still retain ownership of the rabbits found on the course. Also called the home of golf and the Old Course, it has played host to a whopping 28 British Open Championships, the most recent in 2010.

The former Maryland governor will do so in Baltimore, and staging the announcement there could carry risk.

O'Malley has defended his work to curb violent crime in the city and signaled it would play a leading role in his campaign if he enters the presidential race. O'Malley remains largely unknown on the national scene but has offered glimpses of what his campaign agenda might look like, emphasizing that he would focus heavily on economic inequality, campaign finance reform, and a foreign policy focused on national security threats and creating new global alliances.

Ifergan says that in May 2008, he bought two tickets at 8:59pm, a minute before the 9pm cutoff, the CBC reports. The first ticket out of the convenience store's machine was for that night's draw but the next oneâ€”which had the draw's winning numbersâ€”was printed at seven seconds after 9pm and was registered for the following week's draw. If the ticket had been printed a few seconds earlier, he would have shared a $21 million jackpot with another winner.

Loto-Quebec never disputed the fact that my request for the two tickets was in their system at 8:59.47, he tells CTV, saying that had those tickets been bought anywhere else in Canada, I would have been a millionaire seven years ago.

According to police, the teen entered an unlocked home after two prior attempts to break in and was shot by the boyâ€”who was home alone with his 4-year-old sisterâ€”in the front foyer around 2:30pm, per St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A male with the teen who may not have entered the home reportedly fled but is now in custody. However, what neighbors say they witnessed contradicts that narrative: One says the 11-year-old shot the teen as the two talked outside. It was not a break-in, she says. There wasn't a reason why it happened like it happened. A woman tells KMOV the boys were outside arguing loud, back and forth. An 18-year-old neighbor says the boy beckoned the 16-year-old, who appeared to be trying to sell the younger boy his phone, to the porch. She says the boyâ€”whom she saw waving a gun in front of the house earlier in the dayâ€”then shot him. She adds the teen fell forward through the open front door. He was never in the house. Informed of the witness accounts, an officer notes, Obviously the investigation is extremely early and many, many interviews have to be conducted. What is clear: The case is troubling to say the least and shows that too many young people have access to handguns and the results are usually tragic. KMOV reports authorities are questioning the 11-year-old. His mother says she bought the gun used in the shooting after previous break-in attempts.","11-Year-Old Kills Teen, 16, Under Murky Circumstances"

Seattle beat the Packers 14-12. But MD Jennings was certain he had intercepted a late-game pass, and even had the ball clutched to his chest. But it was no go. I was very shocked, Jennings said. But, the refs got the last say, so it is what it is. The confusing final minutes of the game occurred when Seahawk Russell Wilson threw a disputed 24-yard touchdown pass toward Golden Tate in the corner of the end zone as the clock expired. Tate shoved Green Bay's Sam Shields out of the way, then wrestled on the ground with Jennings for possession. One referee raised his arms to signal touchdown while another official waved his arms, apparently signaling a touchback, by way of an interception, notes the Huffington Post. (Or was he signaling that the clock had already run out, as one announcer speculated? It was finally ruled a touchdown on the field, but confusion still reigned. After a long review referee Wayne Elliott finally came out to announce that the ruling on the field stands. It was nearly 10 minutes before the teams were brought back for the extra point. The game is going to further fuel debate about the replacement officials after a wild weekend of disputed calls. Don't ask me a question about the officials, Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy told AP.

It wasn't immediately clear what happened to the jet, which the Moroccan military said vanished around 11am EDT yesterday. The Shiite Houthis, as well as their allies in Yemen's splintered armed forces, have routinely fired anti-aircraft guns at warplanes launching strikes in the country since the Saudi-led campaign began March 26; the Houthis' official news channel said today anti-aircraft guns had shot down an F-16, but that isn't confirmed, per Reuters. There's been no mention of the aircraft in Yemeni media or on the official website of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, whose forces back the Houthis. Morocco's state news agency, citing a military statement, says the pilot of a second jet said he didn't see the pilot of the missing fighter eject. The military says it has launched an investigation into the plane's disappearance. Morocco has six F-16 jets in the United Arab Emirates taking part in the Saudi-led coalition. The ceasefire, scheduled to begin tomorrow, would ease the suffering of civilians who increasingly lack food, fuel, and medicine since the bombing campaign began. However, all sides in the conflict have warned they will resume hostilities if the ceasefire is broken.

The news comes via unnamed US officials, who say the assessmentâ€”the work of spy agencies and completed while the swap was being debatedâ€”found that two others would likely take up active roles, while just one of the detainees would likely steer clear of the Taliban. The Journal sees the assessment as ammunition for lawmakers who have dubbed the swap unwise; one official counters that it's not a rigorous mathematical equation but simply a forecast of what could happen based on the men's former positions, connections, and experience at Gitmo. The two detainees named as likely to return to a senior leadership role are Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a onetime Taliban army chief of staff who we previously reported is wanted for allegedly killing thousands of Shiites near Kabul between 1998 and 2001; and Khairullah Khairkhwa, formerly an interior minister who was directly associated with Osama bin Laden. Abdul Haq Wasiq is the detainee branded by the assessment as unlikely to become an active Taliban member; the Journal reports that before his 2001 detention he had planned to hand intel to the US, and may harbor resentment over that detention in the face of such planned cooperation.",Secret Bergdahl Prediction: Only 1 Will Shun Taliban

Mary Ashford and Barbara Forrest, both 20, spent their last hours alive dancing on May 27â€”but 157 years apart. In 1817, Ashford was spotted in the company of Abraham Thornton around midnight after attending a dance with her friend Hannah Cox. At 4am, Ashford showed up at Cox's house, where she'd left her work clothes, and said she'd been with Thornton, per the Lineup. Hours after she set off for home, her bruised body was found in a water-filled pit in the park by a laborer who followed two sets of footprints from a slick of blood in the grass, per the Birmingham Mail. Authorities believed Ashford was sexually assaulted and drowned, and Thornton was tried for her murder. Though he admitted having sex with Ashford before walking her to Cox's house, Thornton maintained he didn't kill her and was found not guilty after three witnesses backed up his alibi. Fast forward 157 years: Authorities say Barbara Forrest was raped and strangled on May 27, 1974, also in Pype Hayes Park. Forrest had been out dancing with her boyfriend until 1am, when he said he walked Forrest to a bus stop. This time authorities didn't point the finger at the date. Rather, police charged Forrest's co-worker with her murder after bloodstains were found on his pants and an alibi proved false. His name: Michael Ian Thornton. He was later acquitted due to a lack of evidence.

And it looks like the project the BBC says was started by Dmitry Belyae and his intern, Lyudmila Trut, has been a success: By the fourth generation of foxes, the animals were acting much like socialized dogs, wagging their tails and seeking human contact, and they'd physically changed, too, with droopier ears, shorter legs and snouts, and higher serotonin levels, which may have dampened aggressiveness. In the late 1950s Belyae and Trut set out to domesticate a species from the ground upâ€”in a country that Live Science notes banned the study of genetics in 1948, with severe punishments for those who flouted the law. In the beginning, the researchers pretended they were breeding foxes for their fur (and they did kill for fur those foxes that weren't docile enough to continue mating for their real experiment). What's interesting is that the foxes on the farm weren't tamed, per se, which is learned behavior not passed down to the next generation, Popular Science explained in 2013. Rather, a 2009 paper by Trut (Belyae died in 1985, and Trut, now in her 80s, has been running the project since) notes that the meticulously selective breeding led to the neurological and endocrinal changes the foxes underwent, per Discover. Now that the foxes have been domesticated, Trut's next task is to isolate the genes that are altered during this process.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the biggest bombshell for some. The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed for eternity alone, suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were for time and eternity ). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the wrenching trial of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.

Difference No. 3 concerns the solution: Last time, governments had to provide liquidityâ€”sure, it cost $1 trillion and screwed over the average taxpayer, but it prevented a global depression. This time, however, there's plenty of liquidity, but no confidence in US and European governments.

TRAIN_1_2061,"(Oct 17, 2015 3:09 PM CDT) Imagine building a zero-energy home. Now imagine building said house without the use of power tools or nails using files sent right to your inbox. That's the idea behind Clemson University's Indigo Pine designâ€”one of 14 houses presented at this year's US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon in Irvine, Calif. More than 100 students worked for two years on the project, which touts itself as a home that's stronger than most (though it's held together with tab-and-slot connections and some screws and stainless steel zip ties) and can be built in just days, according to a release. Inhabitat explains how the process of building the 970-square-foot, 3-bedroom, 1.5-bath home would work for consumers: Digital files are sent to a local CNC machine which mills over 500 pieces of standardized-sheets of plywood into smaller interlocking pieces. Once shipped to the construction site, the numbered pieces can be assembled like a 3D puzzle. Wall cavities leave room for insulation, while the exterior is clad in a reflective coating that helps beat the heat. The house also sits on a concrete lung foundation of concrete masonry units so air can circulate underneath. The whole thing is powered by photovoltaic panels and a solar hot water system. Our team has invented an energy-efficient, strong, simple system called SimPlyâ€”the construction of which is faster, safer, easier, and more energy-efficient than traditional construction with power tools, the director of Clemson's School of Architecture says, calling the zero-energy home the beta version of what could be a market-rate, flat-packed house that could be ordered online, custom-cut, and then constructed by do-it-yourselfers.",This 3-Bedroom Home Literally Snaps Together

But most skin cancers, including melanoma, are curable if caught and treated early, which is why doctors are anxious to ID them ASAP. Researchers at King's College London say they've found a way to simplify counting one of the disease's prime markersâ€”moles on the bodyâ€”by using a proxy site that would allow physicians to more quickly pinpoint individuals who might need follow-up. Instead of going through the laborious process of counting moles on the entire body, doctors can count moles on the right arm, then use that figure to extrapolate to the number of moles on the body overall, per a press release. And there's a specific number that could serve as a warning sign: Find more than 11 moles on that arm, and your risk of melanoma could be higher. Researchers looked at data from nearly 4,000 female Caucasian twins who were studied between 1995 and 2003. They counted the number of moles on 17 body sites and found women who had at least seven moles on their right arm were nine times more likely to have at least 50 moles all over their body, and that when they had more than 11 moles on their right arm, they were likely to have more than 100 molesâ€”signifying a drastically increased risk of skin cancer, per Live Science. The scientists then replicated the link between arm mole count and total body mole count using another study that included both males and females. The findings could have a significant impact for primary care, allowing GPs to more accurately estimate the total number of moles in a patient extremely quickly via an easily accessible body part, the study's lead author says.

Oh, and they'll end up fatter than people 20 to 40 years ago even if they eat and exercise the same, according to a study in Obesity Research & Clinical Practice. The Atlantic reports that after looking at data from nearly 51,000 Americans, researchers concluded that a person in 2006 eating and exercising the same as someone of an identical age in 1988 had a BMI about 2.3 points higher, meaning they'd be about 10% heavier. Our study results suggest that if you are 25, you'd have to eat even less and exercise more than those older to prevent gaining weight, Jennifer Kuk of York University in Toronto says in the story. Researchers have three thoughts on why that could be, the Atlantic reports. First, we're exposed to more chemicals nowadays, which could be inducing weight gain. Second, prescription drug use is way up, and antidepressants especially have been linked to weight gain. Finally, hormones, antibiotics, or artificial sweeteners in meat and other foods could be changing the bacteria in our guts and hampering weight loss. Kuk says this research is a good reason to be more empathetic to people of all body types.

The brains were those of patients at the Austin State Hospital, formerly the Texas State Lunatic Asylum. They date back to the 1950s, and 28 years ago, after a battle with Harvard for them, they were handed to the university under a temporary possession agreement. Psychology professor Tim Schallert, the collection's co-curator, only had room in his lab for 100 of the specimens, which were kept in jars of formaldehyde. The rest were stored in the basement of the university's Animal Resources Center, reports the AP. Except they're no longer there. The university has vowed to investigate, and Schallert's co-curator speculates they may have been swiped by undergrads for living rooms or Halloween pranks. As part of the brain transfer, identifying information was removed; the Atlantic reports the jars bear an ID number, whatever disease or disorder the patient experienced (in Latin), and the date of death. But any corresponding state hospital records no longer exist. Still, NPR reports that the identity of one brain may be known: that of Whitman, who in 1966 went on a rampage from the observation deck of the University of Texas Tower; he ultimately killed 16 people before being shot and killed. Whitman left behind a note asking that his brain be left to science and examined by a pathologist.

Gizmodo traces the latest to a video from a guy named Frank in the Netherlandsâ€”under the name of Ditrianum Mediaâ€”who claims a 9.8 magnitude earthquake will occur on North Americaâ€™s West Coast tomorrow because he received an important message to that effect directly from Spirit in August 2013. The man says recent earthquakes in Tonga and the Soloman Islands are proof of an imminent Big One that will be caused by the alignment of the sun, Mercury, and Saturn between Earth and the moon. For one thing, earthquakes happen all the time, Gizmodo notes. But more importantly, itâ€™s impossible for a planetary alignment to cause an earthquake. The idea is that the combined gravity of the planets could influence earthquakes, but even under ideal conditions, the planets would have less gravitational pull on the Earth than the moon, which at very best has an extremely weak influence on earthquakes, writes Phil Plait at Slate. And even the alignment is bogus. The software used to display the alignment in the video was adjusted to show exaggerated planet sizes.

And thatâ€™s just those willing to admit itâ€”a full 20% admitted theyâ€™d driven within two hours of drinking, the AP reports. Another 8%, meanwhile, admitted getting in a car even though they believed the driver was intoxicated. The survey also found that the heaviest drinkers were the ones who could not yet legally drinkâ€”those between the ages of 16 and 20 had as many as six drinks before putting their cars in gear.

Prosecutors had sought 15, reports Reuters. Judge John Hlophe had harsh words for the 51-year-old, who has not been named so as not to reveal the identity she gave to Zephany: One would have expected you to apologize but you chose not to. It's also very clear you have caused much harm to Zephany. You have actually betrayed herâ€š Times Live quotes him as saying. The BBC reports Hlophe also cited the birthday celebrations the Nurses held each year for their absent daughter, which were covered by the press and meant it was clear the family was still looking for her. She had all the time in the world to return Zephany, he said, but she obviously did not, the BBC reports. The woman maintained a lady named Sylvia handed a baby to her on April 30, 1997, at a train station as part of a prearranged adoption; Hlophe said the court rejects [that story] with the contempt it deserves, reports the BBC. After South African schoolkids noticed a physical resemblance between two girls, a DNA test in 2015 revealed that one of them was Zephany and the other her younger sister. The unnamed woman, who lived just a few miles from Celeste and Morne Nurse, was arrested.

Kristen Stewart has been tapped to play Princess Diana in Spencer, which is expected to start shooting early next year. The script, penned by Steven Knight, follows the former Lady Diana Spencer over three key days: the early '90s Christmas weekendâ€”at the royal family's Sandringham estateâ€”during which she determined her marriage wasn't working. The film won't touch on Diana's death years later. LarraÃ­n (Jackie) explains the heart of the movie to Deadline: When someone decides not to be the queen, and says, I'd rather go and be myself,' it's a big big decision, a fairy tale upside down. I've always been very surprised by that and thought it must have been very hard to do. The New York Post reports Diana divorced in 1996 at age 36; Stewart is 30. As for the choice of Stewart for the title role, LarraÃ­n describes her as someone who can be very mysterious and very fragile and ultimately very strong as well, which is what we need. ... I think she's going to do something stunning and intriguing at the same time. Hopefully she'll fare better than Naomi Watts did when she played the princess in 2013; the Guardian resurfaces a review in the Mirror that noted Wesley Snipes in a blonde wig would be more convincing.",Kristen Stewart to Tackle 3 Days of Princess Diana's Life

The suspension hasn't downed all dronesâ€”Predator and Reaper drones are still surveilling the country, and will be used to attack an al-Qaeda leader if one is identified.

Some US government officials say such broad attacks are counterproductive, arguing that low-ranking militants can be easily replaced, and that such attacks fuel distrust. Others would like to see the CIA refocus on espionage, while possibly handing paramilitary operations in Pakistan to the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command, which flies drones in Yemen and Somalia.

Indeed, streaming two hours of HD Netflix video would use up a month's worth of data allowed on an $80 Verizon plan, reports the Wall Street Journal. Netflix has actually been doing so for five years but only fessed up after T-Mobile CEO John Legere last week said AT&T and Verizon were throttling their customers' video; they denied it, and Netflix came forward. But it adds it doesn't throttle T-Mobile and Sprint customers. Netflix says that's because they typically face slower network connections, rather than overcharge fees, once they've hit their data limit.

The plan would replace the tax code with a 9% corporate tax, 9% income tax and 9% federal sales tax, which would amount to a big tax cut for the wealthy, who spend little of their income, but a big tax increase for most other families, since it eliminates the deductions they rely on.

Today marks the day in 1915 when hundreds of Armenian intellectuals were arrested; it's viewed as the first step in the deaths of Christian Armenians by Ottoman Turks, an event that's long rankled feathers between Armenia and Turkey: Armenia calls the killings genocide, while Turkey says many deaths took place during WWI battles and that ethnic Turks died, too, the BBC notes. One person raising Armenian ire with his comments: President Obama. Although he refers to the killings as one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century in a statement released today, he refrains from using the word genocide â€”a semantic decision that's not playing well with Armenians. President Obama's exercise in linguistic gymnastics ... is unbecoming of the standard he himself set and that of a world leader today, the president of the Armenian Assembly of America said in a statement. Meanwhile, even Turkey is marking the anniversary in its own way: The country will hold a memorial service today to share the pain of the Armenians, as the Turkish PM puts it, and one of Turkey's oldest newspapers today sported the headline (in Armenian) that said Never Again, the BBC reports.

Immigration Minister John McCallum said work continues to integrate the Syrians into the community. McCallum was at Toronto's Pearson airport as the last two government-arranged refugee flights were arriving as part of the Liberals' $501 million plan. The refugee resettlement program was launched in November, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power and promised to bring in 25,000 government-sponsored refugees by the end of 2015 amid an intense debate in the West over what to do with people fleeing violence in the Middle East. Trudeau later pushed back the date by two months. Canada's commitment reflects the change in government after October's election. The previous Conservative government declined to resettle more Syrian refugees, despite the haunting image of a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach. The boy had relatives in Canada, and the refugee crisis became a major campaign issue. McCallum previously said he hopes to bring in between 35,000 and 50,000 Syrian refuges by the end of the year. In the United States, the Obama administration plans to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees.

Researchers at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics on Friday released a report that puts the US suicide rate at 13 per 100,000 peopleâ€”a 30-year high, per the New York Times. The overall suicide rate rose 24% from 1999 to 2014 after declining in the 15 years prior, with suicides among young girls ages 10 to 14 surging 240%, though such cases are still rare (94 in 2014). An increase was seen in every age group except those over 75. The rate for middle-aged women rose 63%â€”it jumped 80% for white women of this ageâ€”while the rate for middle-aged men spiked 43%.

The suicide rate rose 89% and 38% for Native American women and men of all ages, respectively, but declined by 8% among black men of all ages. The rate also declined for older adults, though men over 75 still have the highest suicide rate overall with 38.8 per 100,000 in 2014.

As Consumerist reports, Prestigious Pets' original lawsuit, which sought less than $7,000, was quickly droppedâ€”only to be replaced with this new suit, which seeks between $200,000 and $1 million. Prestigious Pets originally argued that Robert and Michelle Douchouquette violated a non-disparagement clause in the petsitting contract by posting the bad review, in which the couple complained about some of the company's policies and alleged the petsitter may have harmed their fish. The new suit still alleges the non-disparagement clause was violated, and adds two more claims: defamation and business disparagement. Prestigious Pets says the bad review and the ensuing bad publicity have led to threats and harassment and left the company a shell of its former success, CBS DFW reports.

Researchers compiled data from roughly 4,000 people of varying body weights, then created a computer model that estimates the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease and assesses how weight affects life expectancy. They found that severely obese men between 20 and 39 years of age lost 8.4 years of life compared to their healthy-weight counterparts. Women lost 6.1 years, the BBC reports. Further, those men experienced 18.8 more years of ill heath; the figure for women was 19.1. Obese people could lose up to six years and people who are overweight could lose up to three years, per findings published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology. The younger the individual the worse the potential impact: Those in their 60s and 70s who are severely obese were found to have lost one year, but dealt with 7 more years of ill health. In terms of life-expectancy, we feel being overweight is as bad as cigarette smoking, says lead author Dr. Steven Grover in a press release.

What scientists still don't exactly know is why (an asteroid? volcanic eruptions?), but they now know how long it took. And the answer is ... really, really fast. MIT researchers say the extinction period's duration clocked in at 60,000 years, plus or minus 48,000 years. As Phys.org puts it, that's practically instantaneous, from a geological perspective. To get your geological periods and catastrophic disasters straight: The die-off signified the end of the Permian period and launched the start of the Triassic; the mass die-off of the dinosaurs happened much later, 66 million years ago at the Cretaceous period's close, when LiveScience reports 85% of life was wiped out. The researchers came to their conclusion by using cutting-edge dating techniques on tiny minerals known as zircons found in rocks in Meishan, China, that date to the period. But the rocks also held carbon dioxide data; from there, the researchers determined that a surge of the gas occurred 10,000 to 20,000 years before the die-off: Ocean acidification may have have occurred, and sea temps could have jumped as much as 50 degrees. But what was the source of the increased carbon dioxide that marked the beginning of the end?

The BBC and Telegraph report body parts littered the ground near the Erawan Shrine, where at least 12 people were killedâ€”foreign tourists possibly among themâ€”and 78 were injured. All I can say now is there has been an explosion in central Bangkok involving a motorcycle bomb, a police rep tells Reuters. Another adds, There could be another explosion, so we have blocked off the crime scene and are asking bystanders to move back. A BBC correspondent says burnt motorbikes were seen near the blast site. No person or group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, though the country's defense minister claims the perpetrators intended to destroy the economy and tourism because the incident occurred in the heart of the tourism district. Police say they were searching for two or three other bombs; the Bangkok Post reports via Twitter that police have safely detonated at least one other bomb in the Ratchaprasong area, which also includes three shopping malls and a five-star hotel. The Telegraph reports two small blasts near the entrance of one of those malls left one person hurt back in February.

People with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are four to seven times more likely to commit a crime than their peers, Swedish researchers find. The study, which the AP calls provocative, points to a need for patients to stay on drugs like Ritalin and Adderall beyond childhood. Researchers used Swedish national health and court records to track 16,000 men and 10,000 women with ADHD aged 15 and older, comparing each subject with 10 similar people without the disorder. Over four years, some 37% of men with ADHD were convicted of committing a crime, versus just 9% of men without the disorder; for women, the rates were 15% and 2%, respectively. Medication appeared to cut the risk of committing a crime by 32% among men and 41% among women. Some 4,000 of the 23,000 crimes studied were violent, but medication reduced all types of crime. It's not necessarily just the medication that's cutting crime, a researcher notes: People on meds are also getting other kinds of treatment, including counseling.",People With ADHD 4x More Likely to Commit a Crime

Scientists from Harvard and in Germany, Cyprus, and Saudi Arabia used health statistics and computer models for the study, published yesterday in the journal Nature, to calculate the most detailed estimates yet of air pollution's toll. About three quarters of the deaths are from strokes and heart attacks, says lead author Jos Lelieveld at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, with air pollution killing more people than HIV and malaria combined. The study also projects that if trends don't change, the yearly death total will double to about 6.6 million a year by 2050. With nearly 1.4 million deaths a year, China has the most air pollution fatalities, followed by India with 645,000 and Pakistan with 110,000. The US, with 54,905 deaths in 2010 from soot and smog, ranks seventh highest for air pollution deaths. What's unusual is that the study says agriculture caused 16,221 of those deaths, second only to 16,929 deaths blamed on power plants. The problem with farms: ammonia from fertilizer and animal waste that combines with sulfates from coal-fired power plants and nitrates from car exhaust to form the soot particles that are the big air pollution killers, Lelieveld says. It's not all bad news: A Carnegie Mellon engineering professor says there are ways to reduce that ammonia air pollution at relatively low costs, and Lelieveld said says if the world reduces carbon dioxideâ€”the main gas causing global warmingâ€”soot and smog levels will be cut as well.",Filthy Air Kills 3.3M a Yearâ€”and That May Double

The plan unveiled today by Paul Ryan of Wisconsin also freezes overall spending on domestic programs and repeals most of the spending in President Obama's recently passed economic stimulus bill. Despite the reductions, the plan projects permanent deficits exceeding $500 billion into the future, fueled largely by big tax cuts. The GOP plan would offer couples the option of a 10% rate on the first $100,000 of income, with a 25% rate thereafter.

Segue Construction paid out $3 million in 2014 in a settlement dealing with water penetration issues on balconies in a San Jose apartment complex, the paper notesâ€”issues that Segue blamed on a subcontractor before settling. Segue spokesman Sam Singer tells the Chronicle the San Jose balconies were substantially different in design from the Berkeley balcony. But a second suit Segue settled in 2013 ended with a $3.5 million payout to the owners of a Millbrae condo complex, with a lawyer for the plaintiffs telling the paper water got into the structural wood framing for the balconies and dry-rotted out the wood members, as suspected in the Berkeley collapse. And Berkleyside.com has uncovered yet another lawsuit, still in litigation, accusing Segue of water intrusion causing tangible property damage in Colma, though balconies weren't specifically mentioned.

Second-quarter GDP figures show China's output at $1.339 trillion, well ahead of Japan's $1.288 trillion. Because China is already in the habit of outperforming Japan in the later months of the year, an edge in the second quarter is a strong sign Beijing will finish 2010 ahead of Tokyo. The shift represents a milestone for the global economy, an economist told the Wall Street Journal. China is already far ahead of Japan in purchasing power, but its output per person remains about a tenth of Japan's. But China's economic rise is adding to tensions with its regional trading partners. There are very real limits to China's ability to translate its economic strength into soft power, a regional observer said, citing recent diplomatic rows with Vietnam, South Korea, and Australia.

So if we're living longer, when do we officially become old? According to some statisticians, we cross the magic threshold at 50â€”meaning a lot of us are going to be old for 50% of our lives. You wouldn't think so, though, from the way that older consumers are ignored by marketing and advertising, writes Bedell. Little wonder, then, that the over-50s exist in a kind of identity void ... on a downward spiral of invisibility. The pundits are right: Great hordes of old people could destabilize society, but not just because they're going to cost a fortune: They are going to force us to assess whether our current definition of the good life really adds up. Does it make sense to cram all our economic activity into the first half of life? Why work our longest hours at a time when our children are young? Couldn't we take a longer view, one that would allow us to take gap years at any point, so as to take on voluntary work or go into further education?

It's an infrequent practice but one on the rise in the Netherlands, which is thought to have seen no more than five such cases in 1997 but 42 in 2013. Still, little is known about these cases, write researchers in a report published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry. And so they reviewed the particulars of 66 patients who opted for EAS in the country from 2011 to 2014. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder, but there was also psychosis, PTSD, and anxiety and long-term eating disorders (most had more than one condition). About half had attempted suicide; almost all had a comorbidity (ranging from cancer to arthritis), though the study calls out one healthy 70-year-old woman who simply found her life a living hell in the year after her husband's death. As for how they came to end their lives, the reality of implementing such programs is messy, Reuters notes. In 32% of the cases, the patient had been refused EAS. The physicians for three of those 21 patients ultimately reversed their decisions; the other 18 got approval from a new physician. In 24% of the cases, there was physician disagreement, per a press release, and the New York Times points out that while most patients had long treatment histories, 56% had turned down at least some treatment. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Paul S. Applebaum sees further red flags, among them the 20% who had never been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, the ratio of women to men (2.3 to 1), and the 56% of cases in which social isolation or loneliness was important enough to be mentioned, raising the concern that physician-assisted death served as a substitute for effective psychosocial intervention.

According to the BBC, Russia claims those cruise missiles, which had to fly more than 900 miles over Iran and Iraq to reach Syria, destroyed 11 terrorist targets with no civilian casualties. An anonymous Syrian official tells the Times Russia's help has allowed the army to move from defense to offense in attempting to take back land from rebels. According to the BBC, Russia claims it's targeting all terrorists in Syria. However, that claim is coming under increased scrutiny, and Wednesday's bombings didn't help. So what we've seen in initial airstrikes that Russia carried out beginning last week were primarily targeting places where [ISIS] wasn't ensconced, didn't exist, didn't have a presence, and frankly it was where moderate Syrian opposition forces are generally located, a US spokesperson tells CNN. Turkey claims only 3.5% of Russian airstrikes have targeted ISIS, and critics believe Russia is using ISIS as an excuse to keep the Assad regime in power.

Before today, the building was under construction, and the townâ€™s mayor said structural problems, not recent rains, were behind the disaster. Aid groups, including the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders, were quickly on the scene. The Dominican Republic, which shares the island with Haiti, sent helicopters, and engineers from Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador arrived to help.

In a segment hilariously titled Chaos on Bullshit Mountain, Stewart ran through the network's oft-contradictory attempts to spin Romney's 47% gaffe, showing hosts alternately deriding Mother Jones as an unreliable source, dismissing the comment as a minor gaffe and distraction, and outright embracing Romney's sentiment. Stewart's summary: This inartfully stated dirty liberal smear is a truthful expression of Mitt Romney's political philosophy, and it is a winner. Stewart then attacked the fiction inherent in Romney's remarks, pointing out that the poor and elderly aren't the only ones taking government handouts. Corporations get massive tax breaks and subsidies, and investors get preferential tax treatmentâ€”which saved Romney personally $4.56 million.

But you might be right, and researchers in Britain are currently planning to test that theory. Theyâ€™re about to spend 10 years and millions of dollars trying to build the Babbage Analytical Machine, a massive punch card computer dreamed up by eccentric mathematician Charles Babbage in the 1830s, the New York Times reports. Babbage never built the analytical machine, and experts have spent years arguing about whether it would have worked. Complicating matters: Babbage was constantly tinkering with his design, so thereâ€™s no single blueprint to follow. So a variety of plans will be posted online next year, with the public invited to sort through them and suggest which parts should be incorporated. Researchers will then build a computer model of the room-sized machine andâ€”hopefullyâ€”construct it at the Science Museum in London.

I don't remember deciding to drive that night, so I can't even tell you what was going through my mind when I made that decision, a tearful Kayla Mendoza, who pleaded guilty to two charges of DUI manslaughter in February, told the court. I have no excuses for anything I've done, I just ask for forgiveness. Mendoza, then 20, drank two oversize margaritas at a bar after work, then drove her car the wrong way on an expressway, hitting another car head-on. The crash killed the driver of the second car, Kaitlyn Ferrante, and Ferrante's best friend Marisa Catronio, both 21. How do you forgive someone who's ruined your life and family's lives forever? Catronio's brother said in court. Ferrante's mom told Mendoza, I had to make the choice to pull her off of life support, that's something a mother should never have to do. Both families asked the judge to give Mendoza the maximum 30-year sentence. Though she was only given 24 years, Mendozaâ€”who also had traces of marijuana in her system and a blood alcohol level almost twice the legal limit at the time of the crashâ€”will also serve six years of probation after she is released and will never be allowed to drive again. (The Sun-Sentinel notes that Mendoza never had a driver's license.)

According to the BBC, the 17-year-old had an incurable disease, was in unbearable physical pain, and requested euthanasia, as the law requires; palliative sedation was employed. No other information was provided, and Deutsche Welle reports the records outlining the patient's condition and the deliberation of the panel of physicians who weigh in are generally sealed. The teen's death, which had occurred in the past week, was announced Saturday, Reuters reports. The AFP cites a member of Belgium's federal euthanasia commission as saying the teen was not the first child to request euthanasia. Belgium legalized euthanasia for people with constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated in 2002. It expanded its euthanasia law to cover all children under the age of 18 in 2014. In order to be euthanized, children must be able to understand what it means and get consent from their parent or guardian and death must be expected in the near future. Belgium is the only country in the world that allows euthanasia without age restriction, and a study published this month found 1,807 total euthanasia deaths were reported in 2013, up nearly eight-fold from 235 in 2003.

That's what the experts in charge of preserving Vladimir Lenin's body have done, Scientific American reports. The Soviet Union founder, who died in 1924, would have turned 145 this week, and his mausoleum closed while the preservation team made improvements to his embalmed body. Their primary goal is maintaining the body's look and feel rather than its original material, Scientific American notes: They have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials, so in terms of the original biological matter, the body is less and less of what it used to be, says an expert. That sets the work apart from processes like mummification, he notes, where the focus was on preserving the original matter while the form of the body changes. Now, in addition to the skin replacements, Lenin has false eyelashes, and instead of skin fat, researchers have molded a combination of chemicals to keep his skin looking the same. The body is re-embalmed using a bath of chemicals in alternate years. Lenin has kept scientists busy: During the period between the 1950s and 1980s, as many as 200 experts had jobs maintaining the body, Scientific American notes. Meanwhile, the image of Lenin remains a potent symbol, as two statues of the leader in eastern Ukraine were knocked down last week in protest of Russia, AFP reports.

One of those detained was injured when a car he was in tried to ram police during an attempted getaway. The investigation continues, says Van Der Sypt.

We fear an attack like in Paris, with several individuals, perhaps in several places, Michel said after chairing a meeting of Belgium's National Security Council.

He was behind the wheel of a Budget box truck whose contents could land him in prison for up to five years: more than 10,000 aluminum cans. The Guardian reports that just as Seinfeld's Kramer and Newman once had the bright idea to drive recycled bottles and cans from New York to Michigan to cash in on the state's higher bottle deposit, Everidge was allegedly making a Kentucky-to-Michigan run to do something similar. At 10 cents a pop, Everidge stood to get $1,000 in Michigan versus $0 in Kentucky, which has no bottle deposit; instead, he faces a $5,000 fine and prison time for the felony charge, which is specific to those attempting to return more than 10,000 cans, reports the Livingston County Daily Press & Argus. Officer Clifford Lyden, who stopped Everidge on April 27, testified on Thursday that the Michigan man told him the cans were from Lexington, Ky; and that he didn't pay the deposit on them. (The deposit cost is simply added to the price of the beverage when purchased.) But Everidge's defense argues that because he was pulled over for speeding, he was merely attempting to attempt to return the bottles, and thus caught too early, with the charge of beverage return of nonrefundable bottles not actually applying. Livingston County District Judge Suzanne Geddis determined his case will go to trial. One Michigan law professor says Everidge is unlikely to do time given the $35,000 annual price tag to imprison someone.

And it all comes down to ... Michael Jackson and a big-screen TV? Vulture picks up on this tidbit from former GNR manager Doug Goldstein's interview with Rolling Stone Brazil this week: As Goldstein tells it, Axl was molested by his dad when he was a toddler and believed that Jackson was also a child molester. So when Slash agreed to perform with Jackson at a tribute concert, Goldstein warned him not to do it. I asked Slash, 'How much are you receiving?' Goldstein recalls. And he said, 'Iâ€™ll just receive a big-screen television.' When Axl found out Slash was going to play with Michael Jackson and that the payment was a big-screen TV, he was devastated. He thought Slash would support him and be against all abuse. Goldstein, for his part, believes all Slash may have to do to mend fences after nearly 20 years is apologize.

The boy's family is overjoyed because the birth defect makes him resemble a Hindu god, according to the Daily Mail. The nurses said he was badly deformed, but I could see this was a sign from God, a relative tells local media. In fact, this is a miracle, it's God's baby. Indian gods have extra limbs just like this. A police officer struggling to control the curious crowds, however, says it is tragic and that hundreds of people are praying and crying in the streets; some even believe the birth is a sign of the end of the world. The boy's condition is believed to be the result of a parasitic twin attached to him in the womb. With conjoined twins, you have two living fetuses that are attached either by the head, abdomen, or legs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Hackensack University Medical Center tells Fox News. But with a parasitic twin, it's the same principle, except there is a malformation of one of those twins, he says. As a result, the twin never fully develops and is then partially encased in the living fetus. An eight-limbed girl born in India in 2005 created a similar stir. After a 27-hour operation to sever the twin when she was 2, Lakshmi Tatma was able to walk.",8-Limbed 'God Baby' Draws Crowds in India

The petitioners argued that the crash was not caused, as the NTSB concluded in 2000, by a fuel tank explosion, but rather was likely brought down by a bomb or missile. But the NTSB did a thorough review of the petitioners' information and found no evidence the original fuel tank explanation was wrong, Reuters reports. The NTSB notes that the investigators who looked into the petition were not associated with the original investigation, which remains one of the largest transportation accident investigations in US history. Those investigators found that an analysis of radar evidence provided by the petitioners was flawed, and that witness summaries the petitioners provided from the FBI criminal probe of the crashâ€”which ended in 1997 after finding no evidence of a crimeâ€”weren't much different from the witness summaries the NTSB reviewed at the time.

That number now stands at slightly more than every one in four, according to a new Census Bureau report out yesterday. Some 27.5% of American households are solo households, reports USA Today, which notes that the figure stood at 5.1% in 1900 and 17% in 1970. Researchers are in part blaming the rise on the habits of the young, who are waiting longer to get married, thereby extending the years of bachelor/bachelorette living. To wit, 71% of households were married in 1970; last year, 49% were. Reason No. 2 has to do with the elderly: They're living longer and they're healthier, allowing them to spend more years in their own home, rather than with a family member or in an adult-care facility. If you're thinking, the economy stinks, shouldn't people be bunking up? you're not, well, alone. The Los Angeles Times notes that the increase might seem puzzling in light of the recession and its enduring effects.

Far from taking the hint, the partygoers refused to leave; one instead pulled a knife and stabbed Smith twice. Smith's then-teammate Delanie Walker grabbed Smith's gun and fired it in the air againâ€”only this time another person shot back, hitting two guests. When police arrived, they found five guns, including assault rifles, which are illegal in California, and high-capacity magazines.

But even though McKinsey guesses that Nakamura's inventionâ€”blue light-emitting-diodes, or LEDsâ€”will be worth about $80 billion by the year 2020, the Japanese company Nakamura toiled for 21 years ago paid him a mere $200 for his troubles, because in Japan, custom held that the employer was a substitute for family, and that work was an end in itself, not a means to enrichment or personal glory, Quartz reports. Nakamura left Nichia Corporation, moved to the US, and became a citizen, with Nichia hot on his trail to sue him for stealing tricks of the trade. He countersued, and the two parties settled in 2005, with Nakamura finally reaping what was then worth $8.1 million, the New York Times reported at the time, calling the blue LED the Holy Grail of lighting. Nakamura told the Times that his win changed the system in all companies in Japan in which scientists and engineers were poorly treated, and the paper noted that other inventors had followed suit.

Friends say customers at the gas station are regular, and they also believe Heeringa knew or at least recognized her abductor, Fox 17 reports. Heeringa's disappearance was discovered after customers found the gas station open but empty and called police.

The wide-ranging attacks required a previously unseen level of coordination. In the deadliest attack, at least one car bomb was set off outside a military base, while mortars were simultaneously fired at the base, toppling some buildings and leaving soldiers buried under the debris, officials say. The other attacks included mortar rounds fired at a hotel, a police club, and more than a dozen checkpoints. A military spokesman immediately accused former Islamist President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood of orchestrating the attack. Hours before the attack, the ISIS affiliate in Egypt posted on its official Twitter account pictures of masked militants dressed in black. They were carrying rocket-propelled grenades in a show of force, while flying the group's black flag. The group, previously known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, has launched several attacks against police and the army in Sinai in recent years.

The accident occurred around 6pm in the north Loop. Authorities say the articulated Route 148 Clarendon/Michigan Express bus collided with at least three other vehicles at Michigan Avenue and Lake Street.

We have striking evidence obtained from Yazidis fleeing Sinjar and some who escaped death, and also crime scene images that show indisputably that the gangs of the Islamic States have executed at least 500 Yazidis after seizing Sinjar, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said, calling the killings a vicious atrocity. He added that some 300 women have been taken as slaves. Sudani's claim comes as the Telegraph notes that the Islamic State has threatened hundreds of Yazidis in towns under its control with execution if they refused to convert to Islam by today. That deadline has now passed, notes Reuters; it's unclear if the slaughter referenced by Sudani involves the Yazidis under threat to convert. Meanwhile, the BBC reports that Britain has made its first airdrop of humanitarian aid to the Yazidis. The world has been shocked by the plight of the Yazidi community, says a minister.

The foursome drove to Matthew Barnettâ€™s house, and Paige tells al-Jazeera America that the boys separated us as soon as we got there. One boy took Paige into a room and raped her, after me telling him no, pushing him away, she says. And after he was done, we sat and waited until Matt was done with Daisy. She found her friend in another room, incoherent. She couldnâ€™t walk, couldnâ€™t talk, and just was talking like a baby pretty much, after the boys had given her drink after drink after drink. Worried they'd wake Daisy's brothers in dropping her off, Paige says the boys carried her to the back corner of her house and left her there. And they told me to go inside, that all she needed to do was to sober up, and that she would be OK, and they were gonna be there and watch her. As to why charges in the case were later dropped, Paige said investigators were really blaming us for it. So were others in the small town who called the girls liars, and said all we wanted to do was get people in trouble for something that was our mistake.

Jillian Keenan recounts the Texas woman's ordealâ€”a 9-hour period that saw her visit three ERsâ€”in Cosmopolitan. Ball and a friend went dancing at a Houston club on a Friday night; she woke up, dizzy and foggy, in a bed other than the one she shared with her fiance Daniel. A man she recalled from the club was on top of her. She ultimately got back to her friend, and Daniel was called. It seemed clear to him both women had been drugged. The first ER, which they headed to at 9am, said it couldn't see Ball without insurance, even though Daniel insisted they could pay. The ER was a for-profit freestanding one; those facilities are exempt from a federal law that requires people to be treated regardless of their ability to pay. While Texas has a similar law, there's a loophole ERs that are unaffiliated with hospitals can exploit. At ER No. 2, West Houston Medical Center, a doctor said he couldn't perform a rape kit analysis. He didn't explain why, but gave them a list of hospitals that could help them. In Houston, the fourth-most populous city in the United States, with 2.3 million people, the paper listed only two hospitals, writes Keenan. One was in Galveston. Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center, the other, tried to point her to a 4th ER. Make it happen, Daniel insisted. At 6pm, Ball was finally given a rape kit, in a process that took less than 25% the recommended time. She hadn't peed all day in hopes of detecting a drug. Too much time had passed to find one.

Since the 2005 peak, housing prices have dropped 31.6%, so if this forecast plays out, prices will recover little of what has been lostâ€”leading to what the Wall Street Journal calls a lost decade. In order to get the housing market back on its feet, the economy needs to add jobs, but thatâ€™s a difficult prospect when the economy, in turn, needs a job boost housing would typically provide. The result will be millions of homeowners with little to no equity in their homes; rapidly disappearing equityâ€”$7 trillion lost so farâ€”has already led to decreased consumer spending. Builders and mortgage analysts share the economistsâ€™ fears. With all of the economic turmoil, both domestic and international, there's not much that points to an improving housing market at any point in the near future, says one builder exec. A cycle could result: More underwater mortgages and foreclosures leading to more credit tightening, leading to an even smaller pool of home buyersâ€”meaning fewer people to purchase newly foreclosed homes and fewer jobs in new construction.",Housing Market Will Stink Through 2015

For the first time, that law has been used to kill one of the mountain lions wearing a collar as part of the state's 18-year study tracking the creatures. The mountain lionâ€”also known as a cougar or pumaâ€”called P-56, a male between 4 and 5 years old, was suspected of multiple attacks on animals at a Camarillo property, CBS News reports. The landowner said 12 animals were killed during nine incidents over a two-year period, and that the landowner had taken multiple preventive measures. Those measures included bringing in livestock and penning animals close to buildings if they couldn't be brought in; using hot wire fencing, motion-activated lights, and radio hazing; and utilizing guard dogs. When none of that worked, he was issued a permit, and officials say P-56 was killed at the end of January. The loss of a breeding male is a concern for the study, especially when the population is already very small, the lead field biologist for the tracking project says in a statement. Currently, there is only one adult male in the Santa Monica Mountains that we are tracking and that is P-63, though he acknowledges there are always animals out there that are not being tracked.

That's the question before the Pentagon, which is expected to spend around $1 billion on helmets for its new fleet of state-of-the-art F-35s, the Air Force Times reports. In fairness to the Pentagon, the new helmetâ€”which costs four times as much as any other helmetâ€”is pretty cool. Six cameras on the outside of the plane project images onto the pilot's visor, giving him or her a 360-degree view, including through the bottom of the plane. The helmets also have built-in night vision and display speed, targets, altitude, and more on the visors. The helmet is much more than a helmet, Air Force Chief of Staff Mark Welsh says. Calling this thing a helmet...we've got to come up with a new word. But Dan Grazier with the Project on Government Oversight tells the Times he thinks the helmets are an overcomplicated solution to simple problems. Each helmet is built to the specifications of individual pilots, which means no sharing helmets or reusing them. The Washington Post reports pilots lighter than 136 pounds are currently prohibited from flying the F-35s because they could suffer potentially fatal whiplash while ejecting with the heavy helmet on their heads. In addition, images from the helmet's cameras are jittery during turbulence, and a green glow from the night vision is hurting pilots' vision. Experts aren't sure these will be simple fixes.

I thought, this can't be allowed to sell on eBay, Christianity scholar Geoffrey Smith tells the New York Times of the January listing. It will just disappear into a private collection. So Smith reached out to the seller, got him to suspend the auction, and studied the so-called Willoughby Papyrus. What Smith found: a few lines in Greek from the Gospel of John (possibly John I: 50-51) and unidentified Christian writing on the other side. Smith presented his findings at a biblical-literature conference in Atlanta, and an abstract of the talk said he planned to entertain the possibility that [the secondary text] belongs to an otherwise unknown Christian apocryphal text. What's interesting: Smith believes the fragment comes from a scroll, not a codex, unlike every other known sample of Greek New Testament papyrus. It seems both sides were written by the same hand, so we may have a piece of a scholar's private scroll. That presents a bit of a mystery to a religion professor at Princeton University. If it was in a personal library, and then the same scribe turned it around to write the other text, what does that mean? AnneMarie Luijendijk tells the Times. (See photos of both sides at Textual Criticism.) A blog post by papyrus expert Brice Jones quotes the eBay listing, which stated the fragment belonged to Harold Willoughby, a well-known professor of Theology at the University of Chicago [who] at the time of his death ... had a library of over 3500 rare bibles.

What you're actually seeing in the image, released by the European Space Agency yesterday, is a two-winged nebula made of gas and dust, extending out from two stars, each similar in size to our sun. The larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf, the ESA says in a release. Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports Mashable. With its outer layers ejected into space, the aging star's exposed remnant core illuminates the waste, resulting in the colorful display.

Hewitt all but invented television news over the course of his more than 60-year career, directing legends Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite. He was behind the 1968 launch of 60 Minutes, and directed the first televised presidential debateâ€”something he later came to regret, believing it started a corrosive relationship between politicians and TV. Hewitt, inspired by Life magazine, took the then-standard hour-long documentary format and broke it into three mini-documentaries with 60 Minutes. By its second season, it was among the top 10 shows on television. Asked what the showâ€™s secret was, Hewitt would always reply, Itâ€™s the four words every child knows: Tell me a story.","60 Minutes Creator Don Hewitt, 86, Dies"

After that, they allegedly freed mink from cages at farms in Idaho, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Pennsylvania, along with one lucky bobcat in Montana, reports the San Diego Tribune. They also vandalized other stores and vehicles (including a police chief's car) along the way, say authorities.

Prince Harry is expected to join them early next week. When they went back to Britain after spending the holidays in Canada, the royal couple shocked Harry's homeland by announcing that they plan to step back as senior members of the royal family and divide their time between Britain and North America, while becoming financially independent. Palace sources tell the BBC that Buckingham Palace was blindsided by the statement and the Queen, Prince Charles, and Prince William have asked staff to find a solution. The couple's departure from life as senior royals in Britain, where they have long complained about intrusive and sometimes racially biased press coverage, appears to have been a more carefully plotted escape than anyone recognized, the Guardian reports. They reportedly trademarked more than 100 items, including socks and pencils, under the Sussex Royal brand more than six months ago.

Just a couple of months after he got it in 1979, it slipped from the Mount Tamalpais student's 17-year-old finger as he surfed off Bolinas, Calif., a few months before his graduation. I figured, 'Oh well, that's that,' says Fowler, now 52. To get it back, it's one of those once-in-a-lifetime deals. As it happens, such a deal presented itself, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Fowler recently checked his email to find a straightforward message: If you want your ring back, head to the Whole Foods Market in Pacific Heights. At a scheduled time on Wednesday, Fowler appeared and was greeted by treasure hunter Larry Feurzeig, who handed over the ring he'd dug up on a Bolinas beach weeks earlier. I'm shocked, says Fowler, who gave Feurzeig a bottle of champagne to thank him for the ring that now only fits his wife's finger. Life has a way of continuing to surprise us.

After 10 minutes of digging, he held a ring, engraved with MTS for Mount Tamalpais School and Fowler's initials.

Instead, authorities say, 52-year-old Mohney reached for a gun after arguing with his wife and shot all three of their children before killing himself. The couple's youngest, a 9-year-old daughter, survived. But both of her siblings died along with their father. If he wants to commit suicide, let him commit suicide. To shoot the children, that's cowardly, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said outside the family's home hours after the slayings occurred before dawn yesterday. Wife Cynthia Mohney had run to a neighbor's home about 5am saying her husband had threatened her with a gun. The neighbor called 911, but gunshots rang out before police got there. At the Mohneys' home in Port Orange, deputies found 14-year-old Savannah and 9-year-old Lauren in an upstairs bedroom. Their 11-year-old brother, David, was in a bedroom on the ground floor, and their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him. Lauren is hospitalized and has been upgraded to stable condition, reports WFTV. The slayings occurred as David and Cynthia Mohney were entrenched in a bitter divorce after nearly 25 years of marriage. Court filings showed David Mohney wanted to leave his wife and move with their children to South Dakota. He had recently finished chiropractic school while she supported the family as a physician's assistant. The state's child abuse hotline was notified in June that Cynthia Mohney had a substance abuse problem after an incident at a restaurant, but she had gotten treatment.","Dad in Bitter Divorce Shoots 3 Kids, Self"

A team led by Dr. Hardeep Singhâ€”who recently won the Presidential Early Career Award for his work in this areaâ€”examined three previous studies, also conducted by Singh's team, that looked for error triggers at two major health care systems, like unusual return visit patterns, NBC News explains. And those three studies yielded a rate of outpatient diagnostic errors of 5.08%, per the report. It is surprisingâ€”5%, Singh says of the percent of cases where the first diagnosis was wrong, but the information for a correct diagnosis was present. And one patient safety expert sees that figure as conservative. I would say this is a minimum. Experts tell Modern Healthcare that there are likely numerous reasons for the lapses, among them the way primary care is structured in the US. Doctors just don't have much time due to the pressure to move patients in and out, an American Cancer Society official points out, noting physicians typically have just 10 minutes to arrive at their diagnosis.

His case was written up last month in the Journal of Medical Case Reports, and the report notes that unlike many patients (such as those with dementia) who experience chronic dÃ©jÃ vu, this man is fully aware of the false nature of his and had no memory problems. He's also not subject to any of the neurological conditions (like temporal lobe epilepsy) typically associated with dÃ©jÃ vu. Rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with dÃ©jÃ vu, our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory, not just finding them familiar, says report author Dr. Christine Wells. Wells believes this could be the first-ever case of anxiety causing persistent dÃ©jÃ vu: The man had a history of anxiety, particularly in regards to contamination (he's a frequent hand washer) and that anxiety got worse when he started university. Perhaps anxiety caused mistimed neuronal firing in the brain, which causes more dÃ©jÃ vu and in turn brings about more anxiety, Wells tells the Telegraph. However, the report also notes that after the dÃ©jÃ vu started, the man took LSD once, and from then on the dÃ©jÃ vu was fairly continuous.

Malaysia's airport operator on Monday took the unusual step of posting photos in two major newspapers of the three Boeing 747-200s. The notice warns owners that the airport has the right to sell or dispose of the planes unless they are collected within 14 days. Swift Air Cargo said it legally bought the planes in June and that it has since been in communication with the operator, Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad, which has demanded more documentation on the purchase. We are dumbfounded and perplexed by Malaysia Airport's move. Swift is the owner and we definitely have not forgotten the planes, said Swift's lawyer, Syed Amir Syakib Arslan. In a brief statement, Malaysia Airports said the claim of ownership could not be satisfactorily verified at this point and that it has asked the owner for more information. It said the newspaper notice was a normal legal process for debt recovery. Syed Amir said Swift has given the airport operator the sale and purchase agreement, a legal declaration from the previous Hong Kong owner of the planes on the sale, as well as other original supporting documents to show ownership of the plane. He said Swift is only liable for parking charges since June and not responsible for previous dues but that it was willing to sit down and negotiate with the airport operator.",747s Left Languishing at Airport for Year Are Claimed

The dominant pattern of sleep, arguably since time immemorial, was biphasic, a sleep historian tells Lifeâ€™s Little Mysteries. What that means: Sleep came in two four-hour blocks, with a period of an hour or more in between during which people might pray, think about their dreams, or even visit with neighbors. But that was back when darkness could last as long as 14 hours a night with nothing but candles for extra light, meaning people were more prone to go to bed earlyâ€”and thus have more flexibility with their nightly schedule. Thanks to the invention of the lightbulb, we now stay awake later, leaving us with less sleep timeâ€”meaning that in order to get the same amount of sleep, we have to do it all at once. But when subjected to natural light patterns, one study found everyone still sleeps biphasically, and concluded that such a sleep pattern is actually beneficial.",You Don't Need 8 Hours of Sleep ... in a Row

The majority of people who reach that mark are women, notes Omaha.com. As for that inevitable question about the secret to his longevity, Behrends has a pretty good answer: beer. He always told everybody the reason he has lived so long is drinking one can of beer, every day at 3pm, says daughter Lois. He favors Miller but would be happy with whatever kind was around. Behrends is Nebraska's oldest living resident and quite possibly the oldest man in the nation, notes the website. That part's a little unclear, however, because a California man claims to be 116 and an Illinois man 112, though their age records, unlike those of Behrends, cannot be verified by the national Gerontology Research Group.

Stay with us on this one: As the Guardian reports, the revelation was made because the UK government wants to hold court cases related to national security in secret. And the official arguing that such a thing should not be permitted in the UK cited a US case as an example. David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, said that the FBI was presented with an incredible opportunity in 1998: to listen in on every single Taliban phone call. The FBI had learned that the Taliban had handed a UK-US venue a major telephone contract. Explains Davis, Because the Taliban wanted American equipment for their new phone network, this would allow the FBI and NSA to build extra circuits into all the equipment before it was flown out to Afghanistan for use. Those circuits would allow the FBI to learn details like the caller's name and the number they were calling. But Operation Foxden got mired in a battle between the FBI and CIA over who should take the lead on the project. It finally got authorizedâ€”on Sept. 8. 2001. It's unclear whether the US would have actually gained al-Qaeda- and 9/11-related intel from these calls, but a huge opportunity was missed, Davis said.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, economists are largely agreed that ending the foreclosure spiral and buoying house prices is key to ending the crisis. The variety of techniques fills in some of the gaps in last week's announcement by Tim Geithner of a $700 billion bailout for the financial system, which the treasury secretary said would include housing provisions.

They were certainly right: Archaeologists are now confirming that it isn't just a ship, but perhaps the oldest found in the area, dating back to the 1700s, reports WBOC 16. Growth rings reveal it was made from oak cut down between the Potomac River and Annapolis and fastened with wooden pegs, reports WBAL-TV. The 45-foot cargo ship was likely built at a small shipyard or plantation in Maryland, and charring suggests it was torched by British sympathizers in the 1780s. The day you find a shipwreck in Maryland waters is a momentous occasion, says Julie Schablitsky, chief archaeologist with the State Highway Administration. It doesn't get much better than this. She and her husband, Navy underwater archaeologist Bob Neyland, have been analyzing the ship all summer. They've even recovered a few artifacts and documented the timbers with a 3D laser scanner to reconstruct what it looked like before sinking. The shipwreck will be vacuum freeze-dried in the Maryland Archaeological Conservation Lab for preservation, and perhaps offered in some way for public viewing.

Boomers need a legacy, writes Michael Kinsley in the Atlantic. It ought to be patriotic. And it ought to be accomplished by the time the last Boomer turns 65, which would be 2029. Boomers have 19 years to redeem themselves. His suggestion: Cash. We should pass on to the next generation an America thatâ€™s free from debt, writes Kinsley. Instead of ignoring it, or arguing endlessly about whose fault it is and who should pay for it, Boomers as an age cohort should just grab the check and say, 'This oneâ€™s on us.' One way to start is with an improved estate tax, one that reaches far more peopleâ€”essentially anyone who inherits any significant amount of moneyâ€”but at a much lower rate.

In the study of 900 convicts in Finland, researchers found that those with mutated forms of two genes were 13 times more likely to have a history of violence, reports the BBC. The researchers said that up to 10% of violent crime in Finland can be attributed to people with this particular genetic profile. For the science-minded, the genes in question are monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), which is linked to dopamine levels in the brain, and cadherin 13 (CDH13), which is linked to impulse control, reports the Telegraph. Scientists from Sweden's Karolinska Institute emphasize that human behavior is unimaginably complex and that they are not suggesting screening for criminals. Weâ€™ve observed two genes that have a relatively big effect on violent behavior, but there are possibly tens or hundreds of other genes that have a smaller effect, says one. This is why a â€˜test for criminalityâ€™ is not possible from this study. A scientist not involved with the work echoes the sentiment, telling the Independent that to call these 'genes for violence' would ... be a massive exaggeration.

That's because the US, like other nations, is clustering into city-centered economic regions that need social and economic support. The 50-state model means that federal and state resources are concentrated in a state capitalâ€”often a small, isolated city itselfâ€”and allocated with little sense of the larger whole, writes Khanna, a senior fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. This holds back bigger cities, he adds, and ensures that smaller US cities will be cut off from the national agenda, destined to become low-cost immigrant and retirement colonies, or simply to be abandoned. Khanna wants Congress to look at America as seven distinct super-regions : the Great Lakes, the Great Northeast, the Southeast Manufacturing Belt, the Gulf Coast, the Great Plains, the Inland West, and the Pacific Coast. Within these are urban archipelagos like the Arizona Sun Corridor (Phoenix to Tucson), the Cascadia Belt (Vancouver to Seattle), and the megalopolis from Boston to Washington (where 50 million people make up 20% of the US GDP).

She remembers the posters of missing people posted on lampposts, not on social media, and actual American flags flying everywhere. We were thankfully spared from anguished tweets or status updates from those trapped on the upper floors of the Twin Towers, along with color-filtered smartphone pictures of the burning buildings, uploaded in real time onto Instagram. Nor was there a need for everyone to comment publicly about what happened, or to create a trending WTC hashtag. Birkner isn't condemning the modern penchant for online mourning but pointing out that, had it been around in 2001, it would have changed a lot about how we took in the events as they unfolded, how we parsed them, and also how we grieved. No matter how much we post, people still have the need for deep, offline connection.

Corinthian was one of the country's largest for-profit educational institutions, and NBC News reports the shutdown may be the biggest ... in the history of higher education in the United States.

Judith Bernstein of suburban Philadelphia is an extreme example. She's had eight types over the last two decades, all treated successfully. There was a while when I was getting one cancer diagnosis after another, including breast, lung, esophageal, and the latest: a rare tumor of her eyelids, she says. At one point I thought I had cancer in my little finger. About 19% of cancers in the United States now are second-or-more cases, a recent study found; in the 1970s, it was only 9%. Over that period, the number of first cancers rose 70%, while the number of second cancers rose 300%. This is partly a success story: More people are surviving cancer and living long enough to get it again, because the risk of cancer rises with age. Second cancers also can arise from the same gene mutations or risk factors, such as smoking, that spurred the first one. And some treatments that help people survive their first cancer can raise the risk of a new cancer forming later. Medically, second cancers pose special challenges: For example, radiation usually isn't given to the same area of the body more than once, and some drugs also have lifetime dose limits. Psychologically, a second cancer often is more traumatizing. I think it's a lot tougher for most people, says the director of the federal Office of Cancer Survivorship.

But while Walmart was hit with a $7,000 fine for its role in his death, it has yet to pay up, reports Huffington Post. The reason likely has nothing to do with the amount of the fine, which is the maximum amount the Occupational Safety and Health Administration can fine a company for serious violations.

For Walmart, there could be considerable ramifications if the fine is upheld.

Because OSHA found Walmart at fault using the general duty clause, which rather vaguely puts the onus on employers to make their workplaces free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to [their] employees, upholding the fine essentially means that employers will become responsible for crowd control.

They note that a person of interest in the case, convicted sex offender Lloyd Welch, then 18, said years later that he departed the mall in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared. Welch emerged in the case long ago when, shortly after the disappearance, he told mall security he'd seen a man leave with the girls in a car, the AP reports.

The this Martin Shkreli is referring to is the price hike his company instituted after it last month acquired Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug that the New York Times describes as the standard of care for treating those suffering from the potentially deadly parasitic infection toxoplasmosis. The overnight change made by start-up Turing Pharmaceuticals: from $13.50 a tablet to $750 a tablet. USA Today points out that's a 5,000% increase. Shkreli justified the move by saying the overall impact will be a minor one as there are only 12,000 or so prescriptions for the specialized drug a year, and because the proceeds will go toward developing a newer treatment with fewer side effects. A professor of infectious diseases at Emory University isn't so sure about that plan. She tells the Times that while the drug is accompanied by potentially serious side effects, they're manageable. I certainly don't think this is one of those diseases where we have been clamoring for better therapies, says Dr. Wendy Armstrong. The Times charts the drug's price history: Its 2010 acquisition by CorePharma saw its price hiked from $1 a tablet; that raised sales of the drug from $667,000 in 2010 to $6.3 million in 2011. The most recent price increase could push those sales into the hundreds of millions. As for what Daraprim treats, the CDC describes toxoplasmosis as a leading cause of death attributed to foodborne illness in the US. While some 60 million Americans are thought to carry the Toxoplasma parasite, it causes illness in those with weakened immune systems.",Drug's Price Changed From $13.50 a Tablet to $750

A tip led authorities yesterday to a very remote, narrow road down in a ravine on private property, where the 200-square-foot Hempel Hideaway was found, owner Chris Hempel tells the Spokesman-Review. Someone had it tucked back up in the woods on stilts and constructed a deck around it, apparently making use of materials from now-dismantled bunk beds inside, adds Hempel, who visited the site. It's going to be very difficult getting it out of there. She says there's some structural damage and much of the family's camping gear and equipment are gone and have been replaced with personal belongings. A Stevens County sheriff says police have a suspect but haven't made any arrests. We believe the person who stole this cabin, or people who stole the cabin, were planning on living in it, the sheriff says, per KXLY. Hempel says the suspect is male, but I don't think he could have done that job by himself just looking at where it was and how it was set up. The cabin was stolen from the Hempels' 20-acre property near Nine Mile Falls sometime after March 21. KREM reports a neighbor saw a trailer carrying the cabin away in broad daylight. I was sitting here at my desk and saw the shed go by thinking that somebody got their shed repossessed and found out later that it was stolen, she says.

Though farmers technically buy the policies from private insurers, the federal government guarantees those insurers against losses. It also pays 60% of farmers' premiums, which this year amounted to an extra $9 billion. The program has been criticized for encouraging farmers to till risky land they otherwise wouldn't. If the government takes on much of the risk in farming, paradoxically, farmers adopt riskier production practices, says one American Enterprise Institute scholar. Environmentalists also say it leads to overfarming, and a report out yesterday noted that more than 23 million acres of grass and wetlandsâ€”an area the size of Indianaâ€”were converted to farmland between 2008 and 2011.

I haven't seen anything like this before, says one expert. A team of Japanese researchers discovered the surprising behavior in the species, which lives in the Pacific Ocean, the BBC reports. Chromodoris reticulata is the first creature known to have what they're calling a disposable penis. Other creatures discard their sex organ post-copulation, but they don't re-grow it. The researchers called the slug's behavior extremely peculiar. A large part of the slug's penis is actually an internal one that's coiled inside its body; this is what regenerates the detached portion after sex. The studied slugs were seen to mate three times in a row, 24 hours apart each time; it's not clear if the penis could regenerate once again, perhaps months later. The evolutionary purpose? Scientists aren't quite sure, but they say the purpose of the first sex act may be to remove any sperm left by a previous partner. The disposable penis is far from the slugs' only sexual quirk: The penises are equipped with spines that could help with the removal of prior sperm, AFP reports. The creatures are also simultaneous hermaphrodites, which means they have male and female sexual organs that can be used simultaneously.","This Sea Slug Sheds Penis, Grows New One in 24 Hours"

Authorities are awaiting lab results that might help determine how Serena Faith Profitt of Otis got sick, though they say they may never zero in on the exact source, reports AP. Two possibilities: The pair shared a turkey sandwich at a restaurant over the Labor Day weekend, and they swam together in a pond the weekend before that, reports the Oregonian. A check of the restaurant has raised no red flags, however, and nobody else who swam in the pond has gotten sick. Our investigation is ongoing, says a health official in Lincoln City. There's a lot of field work, then there's a lot of waiting. Serena fell ill and eventually suffered kidney failure and brain damage. At one point, she was released from the hospital, only to return in worse shape. Her family tells KATU that the hospital failed to run tests that would have diagnosed E. coli and might have saved her, and they are planning legal action. Meanwhile, Serena's friend, 5-year-old Brad Sutton, is showing signs of improvement. His levels for his kidneys are coming up ... but heâ€™s not out of the woods, says his mom.","Boy, 5, Sick With E.

The studies were commissioned after the recent surge in military suicides, and they find that most soldiers with suicidal tendencies already had them before enlisting, the New York Times reports. Some of the specific findings, per the NYT and the Los Angeles Times: The kind of people who join the Army are not typical people. They have a lot more acting-out kind of mental disorders. They get into fights more. They're more aggressive, says a sociologist who led one of the studies. The question becomes, 'How did these guys get in the Army?' The results are based on confidential surveys and interviews with a representative sample of soldiers. The studies also found that rates of most psychiatric disorders, as well as the suicide rate, climbed during military serviceâ€”even for soldiers who never deployedâ€”but the reason is not clear. A psychologist who led one of the studies says more than 30% of military suicide attempts would have been prevented had recruits with pre-existing mental illnesses been barred from enlisting. But some experts say such recruits shouldn't be barred, but rather screening should improve so they can be offered more support after enlisting.",Almost 20% of Soldiers Had Mental Illness Before Enlisting

The top six highest-grossing movies ever made are all rated PG-13; the rating points to a film that's titillating enough for teens but isn't likely to offend adults, the Los Angeles Times notes. The rating has become a Holy Grail for movie execs, particularly lately. Last year, R-rated movies accounted for 21% of US box office takingsâ€”the lowest figure in decades. PG-13 movies, meanwhile, managed 54%â€”even though just 35% of films received the rating. This summer will see the release of a host of blockbusters rated PG-13, from The Dark Knight Rises to Battleship, as studios fight to receive the rating. Ratings organization the MPAA has heard nine ratings appeals this year, six of which were efforts to shift Rs to PG-13s. One problem with the R rating: It's an incredibly broad category, making it tough for audiences to know what they're in for, says a Sony exec.",PG-13 Rating: Ticket to Box-Office Magic?

Roland Bourgeois Jr. fired a shotgun at the young men, who were injured, because they were black and entered his Algiers Point neighborhood bordering the Mississippi River, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Bourgeois was one of several white men to erect a barricade and patrol the streets with guns in September 2005 in an effort to block outsiders, reports the New York Times. Anything coming up this street darker than a brown paper bag is getting shot, he said, according to court documents. As the men crossed the barricade in an effort to reach a ferry landing serving as an evacuation site, one was hit in the neck and back, the two others in the arms, back, and legs. Bourgeois boasted that he'd got one, then promised to kill the man, whom he referred to using a racial slur, according to the documents. He also waved around the bloody hat of one of the victims as a trophy, a federal prosecutor says, per the Times-Picayune. This was a premeditated attempt to kill, she adds, per the AP. Though Bourgeois was indicted in 2010, he was found incompetent to stand trial at least five times due to mental and physical health concerns before an alteration in 2018. Having admitted the men posed no threat to him, he pleaded guilty in October to interference with the rights of the men and use of a firearm during a violent crime. Though his lawyer argued for a lighter sentence due to his frail health, Bourgeois, appearing in a wheelchair, was sentenced Thursday to five years for each count, plus five years of supervised release.",Justice for 3 Black Men Shot After Hurricane Katrina

Further, despite a ship-wide ban on alcohol, the officer was found after the accident to have a blood-alcohol content almost eight times the legal limitâ€”a feat facilitated by the presence of an on-board store that the report says was regularly replenished, and empty beer, wine and spirit bottles and cartons found on board after the accident indicated significant levels of alcohol consumption by the crew.

The angry 43-page complaint claims that Gore and Hyatt wooed him with promises that he would be his own boss. But then Hyatt began running Olbermann's program as his personal hobbyhorse, and major business errors became commonplace and acceptable, according to the suit. Two weeks before Countdown began, says the suit, Hyatt threatened to shut it down unless Olbermann reined in his representatives after Hyatt accused Olbermann's manager of leaking contract details to the Hollywood Reporterâ€”triggering claims in the lawsuit that the threat amounted to blackmail. Olbermann deeply regrets his decision to put his trust in Hyatt and Gore, the suit states.

Unlike Paul's 13-hour talkathon in 2013, the talk yesterday didn't qualify as a true filibuster under Senate rules, according to CNN. Paul's office says it was a genuine filibuster, because it prevented lawmakers from extending the Patriot Act while he was talking, though it isn't clear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had intended to file cloture during that time, Politico notes.

The Swedish furniture giant is offering a free kit to help consumers do that. The kit will be available to 27 million consumers who bought chests and dressers above specific heights, including 7 million of Ikea's Malm chests. Ikea and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission say two boys, both around 2 years old, were killed in 2014 after Malm chests that had not been secured to walls tipped and fell on them. They say consumers shouldn't use Ikea children's chests and drawers taller than 23Â½ inches and adult chests and drawers taller than 29Â½ inches unless they are anchored. It's considered a recall, but instead of returning the products, customers are asked to get an anchoring kit, notes USA Today.

A new study tries to answer the question of how little it would take to make bird flu easily spreadable. The conclusion: 5 gene mutations. Controversial Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier in 2011 found the virus could go airborneâ€”something health officials fear could mean an overwhelming pandemicâ€”with nine or more mutations in ferrets, whose immune systems react to H5N1 much as our own do. He and his fellow researchers set out to find the minimum number of mutations needed to make that happen, the Los Angeles Times reports. A ferret was infected with a genetically altered version of the virus and made to share air with another ferretâ€”who eventually became sick. The researchers then uncovered the five mutations at play, two of which made the virus' ability to adhere to respiratory tract cells more robust. The other mutations bolstered the virus' stability and ability to replicate. Two big things to keep in mind: One, it's not known how likely these mutations are to occur outside a lab setting. This certainly does not mean that H5N1 is now more likely to cause a pandemic, says Fouchier. Second, the altered virus wasn't as deadly as H5N1; Fouchier suggests this is because it hit upper, not lower, airway cells. But critics still say toying with H5N1 is dangerous.

The thirdâ€”which would ban Barrett .50 caliber rifles, the most powerful weapon usually available to civiliansâ€”he vetoed outright, reports the Star-Ledger. Though Christie was the one who asked for that particular rifle ban in the first place, he says this bill goes too far, requiring people who already own the gun to give it up, and therefore interfering with lawful recreational pastimes. With the stroke of his veto pen, Chris Christie has put New Jersey communities at risk of serious gun violence, Democratic Assemblyman Louis Greenwald wrote in a statement, per the Philadelphia Inquirer, opining he has put his national political ambitions ahead of protecting New Jersey's families. Christie has also come under, er, fire for saving his action on the bills until Friday night, when the media typically isn't paying attention. He did sign one gun control bill yesterday, which will create a task force on school violence, notes the Star-Ledger, and 10 other less controversial ones earlier in the week.",Christie Refuses to Sign 3 Gun Control Bills

According to Sky News, the pregnant 41-year-old had refused treatment for cancer so as not to harm the fetus, though the BBC reports that her brain tumor was incurable and Al Jazeera reports that she arrived at the hospital in Poland already brain-dead. But her heart was still beating, so a team of specialists took extreme care to allow the then 17-week-old fetus to grow. It's rare to successfully maintain a pregnancy for so long, says Barbara Krolak-Olejnik, head of Wroclaw Medical University's neonatal unit. But the family wanted to try. Anesthesiologists, neonatologists, gynecologists, and neurosurgeons all fought to keep the fetus alive in spite of infections and other disorders the mother was suffering, reports Ukraine Today. The goal was to make it to at least 25 weeks; 26 weeks into the pregnancy, 55 days after the mother had technically died, the baby's life was deemed at risk. He was delivered by C-section in January weighing just over two pounds, and the mother's life support was subsequently turned off. Now, three months later, after his father spent every day with him, reading fairy tales through an incubator as the infant's lungs developed, the baby is home. He now weighs more than 6.5 pounds and thus far shows no complications. (Something similar happened in Nebraska last year.)","Mom, Brain-Dead for 55 Days, Delivers Baby Boy"

Thanks to 24 million out-of-date and inaccurate voter registration records, the United States has up to 1.8 million dead people registered to vote, reports USA Today. We have a ramshackle registration system in the US. It's a mess. It's expensive. There isn't central control over the process, said one expert. Despite 2.75 million duplicate registrations and other problems, the Pew Center for States, which published the study, says there are still 51 million eligible citizens not registered to vote. The flawed voter rolls go beyond just voting cemeteries. In Wood County, Ohio, for example, there are 106% the number of registered voters as people in the 2010 census. Experts point to the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which made it easier to register to vote and harder to kick someone off. The problem is especially bad in the vital swing states, where national elections are frequently decided, as both parties work hard to sign up as many voters as possible. Pew suggests enacting a multi-state database to track voter registration more efficiently, using driver's licenses, death certificates, and other documents.

But the Australian Transport Safety Bureau cautioned that the drift analysis by Australian science agency CSIRO is based on French military satellite images of probably man-made floating objects without evidence that they were from the airliner. Still, the locations could provide potential starting points to search within a 9,700-square-mile expanse identified as the most likely resting place of the Boeing 777. That expanse adjoins the original search zone of 46,000 square miles identified through satellite analysis of the final hours of the flight. The new analysis is based on satellite images gathered two weeks after Flight 370 vanished, taken near the original underwater search zone. Satellite experts at Geoscience Australia were not asked to analyze the images until March this year. They concluded that a dozen objects appeared to be man-made and might have originated from three potential crash sites. Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Aziz Kaprawi says the civil aviation department would need to verify the data to see if it's credible before we make any decision on resuming the search for the plane, which ended in January.

But the real story is a bit more complicated, as Zack O'Malley Greenburg explains in Forbes. A press release issued this week explains that Jay Z bought out Sovereign Brands' stake in the company. But the rapper has always had a financial interest in Armand de Brignac, Greenburg writes. The backstory: Jay Z used to favor Cristal, but in 2006, the manager of the company that makes that champagne was asked about Cristal's popularity with rappers. His reply: What can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it. Jay Z called for a boycott of the champagne; later that year, a bottle of Armand de Brignac champagne, nicknamed Ace of Spades for its logo, appeared in the aforementioned music video, and still later that year, the champagne started being sold in North America.

The 37-year-old had wanted to remain anonymous, but such a feat isn't possible in Arizona, where lottery winners are a matter of public record. The AP learned his name after filing a public records request. Here's what it has since pieced together on him: Good is married, and moved from Pennsylvania to a $289,900 2,500-square-foot home in what the AP describes as an affluent Phoenix suburb last year. Lottery officials described him as a professional who has no immediate plans to quit his job, though he certainly could: Good took the one-time payout of $192 million, telling lottery officials the looming fiscal cliff was the reason he claimed the winnings now and not in 2013. Neighbors described Good pleasantly, telling scintillating tales about how he once helped carry a table to a neighbor's house. He apparently spent $10 on tickets; the winner sat in the visor of his car overnight before he realized it was a winner.",2nd Powerball Winner Named

Van der Merwe and his surgical team at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, recently completed their second successful penile transplantâ€”this time on a 40-year-old man who lost his penis 17 years ago during a botched circumcision ritual. The team performed the world's first penile transplant in 2014. The unnamed patient is doing well and should have complete sexual and urinary function within six months. It's said he got quite emotional when he saw his new penis, the International Business Times reports. For these men the penis defines manhood and the loss of this organ causes tremendous emotional and psychological distressâ€š Times Live quotes Dr. Amir Zarrabi as saying. The world has seen only three penile transplantsâ€”one was performed last year in Boston, UPI notesâ€”but there's a big need for the surgery in South Africa, where it's estimated there are up to 250 penile amputations every year due to traditional circumcision rituals. As an initiation rite, young men are circumcised with a spear tip then sent into the wilderness for weeks, during which time infection often sets in. The transplant procedure requires reconnecting tiny blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and the urethra and making sure blood can flow for erections. It's complicated by cost, a lack of donors, and the need to use medical tattooing to match skin tones. Doctors are trying to figure out how to reduce the cost while increasing donors.

Those dreams were cut short yesterday when the 23-year-old, his 21-year-old wife, and her 19-year-old sister were shot dead in an apartment complex near the college, NBC News reports. Craig Stephen Hicks, the suspected 46-year-old gunman, is being held in Durham County Jail on three charges of first-degree murder, police say. Police received a report of gunfire shortly after 5pm yesterday in the Chapel Hill neighborhood of Finley Forest; all three victims died at the scene. In a statement today, CHPD reports our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking. The Charlotte Observer notes that all three victims were Muslim, and speculation is rife on social media that it could have been a hate crime. The Independent notes a Facebook page in Hicks' name that shows him to be an apparent supporter for Atheists for Equality and a frequent poster of images that mock religion. What CHPD has to say: We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case. Barakat's wife, Yusor Abu-Salha, was scheduled to start dental studies at UNC in the fall; the two worked together to lobby for global public health and had just married on Dec. 27 (wedding photo here).

Parents said at least five students ranging in age from 6 to 11 were arrested at Hobgood Elementary School because they allegedly failed to intervene and stop an earlier fight that happened off-campus in their neighborhood, the Daily News Journal reports. A local church hosted a community meeting about the incident Sunday afternoon, in which more than 150 people called for an investigation. The police chief says the department will review the incident. A video of the fight was recorded, and police officers later tracked down students who didn't put a stop to the fight; it's not clear who shot the video or how the police got a hold of it. Three people, three kids all having to be arrested, all having to be processed entered into the system and they didnâ€™t do anything, says one father who claims his 9-, 10-, and 11-year-olds were arrested and booked into the detention center even though only one of them was present at the fight.

Some family members and friends wore T-shirts that said Pray for MH370 to return home safe and sound and wept as one man read a speech about his lost daughterâ€”which prompted plainclothes police to separate reporters from mourning relatives and tell families they could only enter the temple two or three at a time. Families of the missing passengers say Chinese law enforcement has been shadowing them as they protest the lack of progress in finding the plane, which disappeared March 8. Search teams are focused on a 23,000-square-mile section of the Indian Ocean, which may be expanded after scrutiny of a failed call made to the plane, reports the AP. The families remain frustrated. Says one woman who lost her sister, We feel very helpless ... because we need to rely on the government for their assistance and support and hope they can put pressure on the Malaysian airline to find out the truth.

But the Agriculture Department confirms that's what has hit an egg producer in Osceola County, Iowa; it's the biggest outbreak so far in the current H5N2 bird flu epidemic. CNN reports that all of the hens will be euthanized; officials previously told the New York Times they didn't yet know how many of the 25 barns at the farm were affected, though birds in three barns had already been killed in an effort to halt the spread. When there's an outbreak like this, you have to make sure the disease doesn't leave, the state's ag secretary tells the Des Moines Register. Iowa is the biggest egg producer in the country, and the farm in question accounts for almost 10% of Iowa's egg-laying hens. The outbreak has hit chicken and turkey producers in 13 states, many in the Midwestâ€”Gov. Scott Walker declared a state of emergency in Wisconsin yesterday and authorized the National Guard to get involvedâ€”and has killed almost 7.8 million birds since last month.

US fans were screaming for revenge today after the Black Stars eliminated the Americans from the last two World Cups. They got it. At a price. Clint Dempsey scored a shocking goal a half-minute in, but the US couldn't make it stand up. Andre Ayew tied the score in the 82nd minute after a brilliant back-heel pass from Asamoah Gyan, who had eliminated the US four years ago. And then, just four minutes later, 20-year-old John Brooks rose to head in Graham Zusi's corner kick from 8 yardsâ€”the first substitute to ever score for the United States in 30 World Cup games over 84 years. (He replaced Matt Besler, who came out at the start of the second half after feeling tightness in his right hamstring.) The defender, an unexpected addition to the American roster, was so overcome he fell to the field and was unable to move even after teammates climbed off the dog pile. He had made his national team debut only last August, and Brooks hadn't scored in four appearances. US players ran onto the field to celebrate at the final whistle, jumping as supporters chanted U-S-A! U-S-A!

The results were downright dismal: TSA agents failed 67 out of 70 testsâ€”that's 95% of themâ€”conducted by Red Team operatives, agents posing as passengers who devised the most devious ways to sneak items past the screeners, ABC News reports. The testing dates haven't been revealed, officials briefed on a recent Homeland Security IG report say, but ABC notes that Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson was said to be so frustrated by the findings that he demanded a meeting last week at TSA headquarters. According to the TSA Blog, the agency had a busy year in 2014, checking out more than 653 million passengers and finding more than 2,200 firearms. But Red Team membersâ€”once described by a TSA administrator as super terrorists familiar with every weaknessâ€”got around security in astounding numbers. One undercover agent set off a magnetization alarm but still got through with a fake explosive taped to his back, even after a follow-up pat-down. Meanwhile, a DHS statement says some vulnerabilities have been addressed: Upon learning the initial findings, Secretary Johnson immediately directed TSA to implement a series of actions, several of which are now in place.
